That's what we're talking about today on sounds profitable for me, Brian Barletta.</div><div>This episode is sponsored by Claritas. Check out their recent, the marketing insider podcast, and learn how to use current trends such as industry specific lifts, success and CPM comparisons in podcasting to increase advertiser adoption, go to claritas.com for more info.</div><div>I know that you're listening to sounds profitable because podcast ad tech is important to you. But it's important to me that you are kept up to date on the latest news from the entire podcast industry to help with that. Here's what happened last week. No matter when you're listening from James Cridlin at pod news.</div><div>Brands looking to advertise their podcasts are often told that host read ads. Aren't easy to scale, but sometimes the less easy paths provide the best results every month. Our guest Jordan harbinger of the Jordan harbinger show puts in considerable effort backed by tens of thousands of dollars to advertise his podcast.</div><div>On other podcasts. I wrote about this in my article, how to buy host, read ads at scale, which I'll link to in the description. Jordan has found amazing success with this strategy. And he was kind enough to share his knowledge on the subject with us, for the people who aren't familiar with you did you, you get into managing your ads, like the content creation.</div><div>You got a great idea. You you've made your show, but like, What made you decide to not just have somebody else handle your ads?</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>Well, first I did want to have somebody else handle my ads and I called friends of mine at agencies. Well, actually that wasn't even my first stop. I first started talking to people that worked in marketing at networks, and I said, Hey, do you ever freelance, you know, a little side hustle, a little kind of moonlighting.</div><div>Is there anything that I can do to hire you? And. I got a lot of yeses. And then like five months later, they were still like, oh, I'm just really busy right now. And I thought, you know, I don't like waiting for people. How specialized is this knowledge? So I hired some freelancers at another network to just give me proposals.</div><div>Right. I said, just, if you had to plan this. And you weren't executing it cause you don't have time. What would the proposal look like? And they were like, well, I would advertise. Here's how you buy some ads on Twitter and here's how you buy some ads on Instagram. And then we'd have you buying Facebook ads.</div><div>And I paid a guy who was a Facebook ads specialist just to test this. And I get, I got conversions for like six or seven bucks. But they're not even subscribers. All we know is they went to the page that I had the play around for the Dennis Rodman episode. And I went, you know, these are not people that we even know, listen to podcasts.</div><div>Like we think they do, but they clicked over from Facebook. And so there's just so much loss. And then I said, you know, I'm not convinced that a lot of these people really know what they're doing. I don't think there are clueless or scammers. I just think when you are 27 and you work at a big company or a medium company, and they're like, you have a hundred thousand dollar marketing budget, are you thinking, how do I get the best bang for the buck?</div><div>Or are you going, let me do something. That's not going to get me fired, not going to get me in trouble. Sounds good on the face of it. So I think that's what a lot of marketers do when they're. Sort of charged with marketing a podcast. They go, well, we've never done this before. And these are the people that had marketed podcasts before most places did.</div><div>And I'll get to that in a second. But, uh, you know, the you're charged with marketing a podcast. You just go, you know, a lot of people listen to podcasts, target them on social. Cause you can select listens to podcasts. Or you can say like lugs Joe Rogan or something like that, but it's just, there's so much loss.</div><div>So I decided how hard can this be? And then I called agencies thinking I'm just going to buy podcast ads and be done with it. Let me figure this out. So I call agencies and agencies go, yeah, you need a budget of, you know, six figures, multiple six figures, seven figures, before you can even sign with us. We take 15% of the spend and I was like, wow.</div><div>So I'm paying you like $50,000 for my experiment here to manage it. And then, I don't know if you messed up or if this just isn't gonna work. There's all these black boxes. I can't really get updates every day. I can get updates like every two weeks or something of the agency's going to send it to me or every week.</div><div>From some assistant. And they also wanted me to know that they'd never advertised a podcast before they've advertised blue apron and they advertise, uh, this kind of mince and these kinds of clothes, but they never advertised a podcast. So I go, okay, so I'm paying you a lot of money. To buy ads, but you also kind of don't really know what you're</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>doing.</div><div>That's the model. Right? All these big companies come to be. And that's, it's so interesting to me that they told you that they've never done it before. Like that's I asked</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>and I said, how many podcasts do we advertise? What kind of growth can I expect? And they're like, well, truthfully, we've never actually worked.</div><div>We never grown a show. You know, we've we buy for direct response advertisers and I went, okay, fair enough. And then I thought to myself, This is probably not that hard. I'm just going to buy ads from my own network podcast one and get like a really good sweetheart deal. Bother him all the time about the results and this and that.</div><div>The other thing I got a chartable kind of premium subscription or whatever you want to call it and started running, tracking with smart promos. And then when I started getting things, working on podcast one, I started buying from friends of mine and I was like, can we try this? Can we try that people that would answer my calls just in case there was a mistake.</div><div>And then I started to scale it up. And now I realize, okay, agencies didn't really know how to do this. Networks really don't know how to do this. They just hire a few 20 somethings and they're like, you're in marketing now. You know, some of them do well, but really the, the networks that are doing well, they grow, they grow by advertising on other shows on the network.</div><div>They don't really buy ads. Well, I'm on a network where I can run it ads on other shows, but then I'm limited to those shows. So that's why you see that's a theory. Y you see, let's say true crime networks that have like 20 true crime shows and they launched five a quarter because true crime people listen to true crime and it's a cash cow.</div><div>So they can just launch true crime, true crime, true crime, true crime, and they can advertise it, like get, get 200, some thousand dollars worth of advertising essentially for free from their sister shows on that network. And then make that show successful. I didn't have that luxury, but also I realized it's kind of one of those.</div><div>Those things where since no one is doing this, there's no path. There's no road more traveled, I guess. Yeah, but also there's no competition. So when I'm advertising on other shows, I go, look, I can't afford to pay you what blue apron pays because I'm doing a podcast, a podcast ad read some agencies and networks they'll say, or some networks I should say, will say, no, we don't advertise what their shows find, write them off next, but other other times they'll say, well, we understand.</div><div>You're not making any money right off the back of it. So we'll give you some unsold inventory at a much discounted CPM. So that's what I'm buying now. Right? So I'm getting a pretty good deal. Uh, and over time, as long as my show, doesn't suck and listeners stick around for a couple of years or so. I will make a lot more money than what I spent, but it is a gamble.</div><div>Like you don't really know, like how are people going to stick around? Are they going to share it so far? That's been the case, but I've only been running this experiment for about a year, a</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>year. And that's the thing because you're buying a listen and you're hoping your content is good enough. To convert for a subscription that they subscribed to it and keep listening to it.</div><div>So that then a month or two later, your numbers are updated or even a quarter or two later, your numbers are updated so that when you pitch to future advertisers, you can charge a higher price or have more inventory for them. And so that's like when you're buying this inventory, it's so many steps removed.</div><div>There's so many points of failure. Yeah, cool. That they're comfortable with that. And that they'll give you, you know, a discount on those rates because like blue apron, every conversion makes the money. If you get into their free trial and you, they don't convert you well, that's a bigger problem. These people aren't like giving you, like driving to give you an email address or anything like that.</div><div>You don't have any way to contact them. You just know this person listened to this podcast in my ad. And then came over and listened to one of my episodes. And even right now, w we've we were just shooting the shit about this earlier that there was, there's still not enough information to show, like, did they stick around?</div><div>Did they subscribe? I, the data is there, but you're, you're so right about that 27 year old thing. And sometimes I think it's even younger, like. I tried to explain to people why people don't dig in more to this. And it's because these people that are so junior they're three to four steps up from them.</div><div>Someone decided that this is the strategy that's going to go on. They gave them a budget that they're responsible for. They'll absolutely get fired. If they aren't successful. It's not even about getting like a bonus. It's about maintaining your job and you're that person 3, 4, 5 levels above them. Isn't going to open a document.</div><div>Isn't going to read your pitch. They want you to put that screenshot. Into the email that says up into the right success, right. They just want to see that arrow going up and showing improvement and that's it. And so to convince that 27 year old, like, Hey, let's take a gamble on podcasting when best case scenario, their boss's boss's boss takes credit for it.</div><div>And then they tell them, don't do that again. And worst case scenario, they get fired. Like. It's, it's hard to convince those big structures to do things like that.</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>Plus they can always point to best practices and say, what do you mean advertising on Facebook? Everyone does that. Everyone's got Instagram ads.</div><div>We targeted people that liked, uh, Dr. Death with this ad. So of course, they're going to find out we have an issue and look that probably works to some extent, but if you want to reach look a hundred percent of people listening to podcasts. Know how to listen to podcasts. That sounds really dumb and obvious, but what people, if it's that obvious, then why are you advertising on Facebook?</div><div>Where somebody scroll or Instagram, where somebody scrolling, looking for cat photos, or like looking to find some D girls dancing or whatever's on there now, which is a lot of that. And then it's like here, listen to Malcolm Gladwell, talk for an hour about his new book. It's like, Hmm, no, but if you're listening to a podcast with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, and then I say, Hey, or better yet, they say, listen to me on the Jordan harbinger show.</div><div>It was a really good interview. That's a better ad and everyone knows how to find my show from there. And everyone likes that particular guest and everyone trusts that particular host with a few exceptions. Uh, I guess people hate listen to certain shows, but I don't advertise on those generally. So this strategy works, uh, and you can see it because yes, it's up into the right, but I would absolutely have fired somebody if I were some sort of like executive and this kid says, so we spend a bunch of money and we kind of hope it comes back around.</div><div>They can look at these Facebook analytics and go. 97.1% of these people clicked through and they clicked on the website and they're from Albuquerque and Michigan and USA only, you know, they have all those analytics that are pretty, that we don't have in podcasting. And so they don't get in trouble for doing it, but I don't want to not get in trouble.</div><div>Right. I'm, I'm spending a lot of my own money. So I want real results and I'm willing to take risks, which is probably why I own my own business. And I don't have investors, you know, I'm the investor. So I don't have to answer to anyone. Yeah. You</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>get to, you get to be the person, take all the risk and put all the effort into it.</div><div>It's, that's so funny, like the, all those statistics and they can prove and all of that, you know, I wonder if that's actually valuable and we're chasing that, or if that's a justification of these bloated systems that we have, I think there's some amazing agencies out there. I think there are some amazing networks and things like that, but the general structure of these holding groups and stuff like that, that take 15% of 15% of 15% all the way down, right.</div><div>To the point where the publisher or whoever's getting the inventory is getting a $10 CPM, but they're charging the advertiser a hundred dollars sometimes. Um, There's a lot of justification done with these overzealous data points to, uh, value all the hands that are in the pot. And like you, like, you've taken risks that are on par with what the management fee would have been.</div><div>For this, someone to do this, like you can do a lot more hands on. I think the tool is there. I would love more metrics on there, but I think the tools that we have there and you've absolutely, hands-on proven it. They're good enough for directional and that's what we need. Right. You're not going to get exact, you're not going to know one-to-one but those stats will tell you if a show fails or succeeds.</div><div>And if you want to want to continue advertising with them or find something similar or how to pivot out from there.</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>Yeah. Yeah, you're right. And look, I can look at my tea leaves, AKA my show data. And I can say here's what I was an advertising and it was going up 200 downloads per episode, per month, maybe.</div><div>Right. And some months were up and some months were down. And that was nice, or it was like 500 or maybe even a thousand. Wow. A thousand more people are listening to each episode as of this month. And then when I started advertising, it was like 11,000 more people are downloading each episode of the show.</div><div>4,000 people are downloading each episode of this show, 7,000, 12,000, sometimes 2000. So it's. And it's every single month. So that shows me that you can really throw gasoline on this fire. Now, of course, ads are really expensive. So like you said before, then when I'd get my new projections at the end of the month, then when they craft a new proposal at the, you know, the, after that they use those numbers and then they come back in a month and say yes to the proposal, and then they run the ads.</div><div>So I'm like three to six, whatever months. Maybe at the highest six months behind. So my rate is trailing. Does that make sense? Like I don't get 2000 downloads, more per episode and then podcasts one sales team goes great. Well, we're going to charge this much more now, starting tomorrow. All right. This company is buying ads.</div><div>It's like proposals went out for the ads I'm getting now. And proposals went out in December. Probably. Yeah. And this is late February and that's maybe the proposal went out in October. I don't know. So the sales cycle is long enough and that's what I'm waiting for. So my strategy here is to, to run the growth strategy for a few years, pretty much non-stop until I either see decreasing ROI or I'm like, you know what, um, they're unable to increase my rate because it's no longer doing well for Dr.</div><div>And th this is a phenomenon you probably know more about, but. I found this out because I started buying huge shows and it's like, oh my gosh, this show has 450,000 downloads per episode. What can I afford this? And the sales guy will go look, all right, I'm going to give it to you for like 15 bucks CPM.</div><div>And I go, okay, wait a minute. Why, why are you giving me a weekly show for 15 bucks CPM that you said does well, what's the, what's the rub? And they go, well, I mean, it's 450,000. But it's no longer when it was 50,000, it was all tech guys working in information security. And that's the only people who listened to this.</div><div>So it killed for Dr. And it killed for people targeting computer experts and it killed for people that were targeting males ages 25 to 40. Now it's 450,000 people. We got. Soccer moms in Ohio, we have all the, so the targeting, it gets diluted to the point where it no longer actually converts as highly.</div><div>And I'm like, okay, I want to stop paying for listeners at that point because my CPMs just going to go down. Where does, like, my money spent is going up. That's a bad place for me to be, because then it takes me longer to earn the money back that I've invested. So as long as my CPM is like 20 bucks or to 30 bucks, I'm good.</div><div>But as soon as it starts popping down to like 15, I'm done growing, at least done spending on growth.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>And so do you get to be hands-on in how the campaigns are running on your show? Right? Like, so podcasts, one brings in a sales, like an ad campaign that they've sold. Are you able to see the performance of it to make sure that it's converting with your expectations so that you can tweak your ad buying to grow your own show in the right direction?</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>I get dude's. Does he, did he advertisers that are on the Jordan harbinger show? Tell me if they're doing well or not. Yeah, no, they, so this is something that I thought more people would do, but it makes sense why they don't and I'll tell you why. So if I am. Blue apron and I buy blue apron.com/jordan. I might as well.</div><div>Right? So if I'm blue apron, if I'm blue apron and I buying ads in the Jordan harbinger show, and every time I run an ad and it's through, let's say it's 30 to 50 for the, let's say it's $3,000 for the ad for the sake of math here. If I sell $4,000 with the meals, Do I go, Jordan, you are killing it. You are selling $4,000 for every $3,000 we spend with you.</div><div>We love you. What am I going to do? Oh, really? That's funny. You should say that because now ads are $3,900. Thanks for letting me know. So. They never say anything. All they do is go, Hey, so, um, we want a lot more ads. What do you say to eight more spots? And I go, great. Yeah, show me the money. Um, but I know what they mean is we're making at least $3,100 for every $3,000 that we give you, but I don't turn around and go well, in that case, the price is higher because I want the bulk buy, but I don't know by how much, but when you have a sponsor and I have plenty of these that stay with me for like two years, I go.</div><div>Man, we lit so much, we wasted so much money, not knowing how well this ad was doing, because if you stayed with us for two, three years, we must be just spinning money out at you. Every single time in the ad runs, it must be just murdering it.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. Because they, they, they just benefit from all this growth that you're doing.</div><div>They lock you in now. I mean, That's the smartest thing. If you see results in a podcast and you're probably doing the same exact thing when you're buying inventory and other podcasts, if you find a podcast, that's just killing it with the getting you listeners and their growth is steady and you could lock it in for a year or two at the rates that they're doing there.</div><div>You're probably going to evaluate it.</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>Yeah. Yeah, I do. And, um, I have, as long as I got a 30 day out, so like, cause I've, I've bought shows and I'm like, Hey, you're delivering 50% of the impressions that you were before. And they're like, yeah. Before the election, we were at 62,000 downloads per episode, and now we're at 45,000 because nobody's listening to.</div><div>Election news.org podcast or whatever. Right. It's just not popular. So there's a lot of that. Um, you know, what else is funny is, uh, using a tool like charitable, which tells me the number of impressions. I got to give them a plug cause they've been killing it for me. Um, with it's like a, almost like beta, but really doing it.</div><div>It's like a magical system that shows me how many things are converting. I have heard and I won't name names, but I've heard from many ad networks and shows that I buy I'll say something like, Hey, so on chartable it says 42,000 and I bought 65,000. Can you give me a screenshot and they'll go. Okay. So it looks like we're a little under, we're going to give you some make goods.</div><div>So we're going to make up the impressions and then it'll happen again. And I'll renew and I'll say, Hey, you know, your conversion is good and they'll revise the number downward. And they go guess the new numbers, 45,000 downloads. We thought we had 62, we have 45. Now, you know, we're going to change the rate.</div><div>And I said, how often do you change the rate? And they go. I think this is the only time I've done it. And I go, how long have you been there? And they're like four years. And I go, so you really are changing the rate because I found that you are under delivering. But you don't see that if you're blue apron, because you just go, Hey, this converted well enough at renewal.</div><div>I don't care. A forty-five thousand people heard it, or a 65,000 people heard it, but you kind of do because even if 65,000 people hear it and only it looks and it performs well, but it performs at the same rate as the show with 45,000 people. Well, 20,000 extra people. I became aware of your brand. They heard about you, you paid for that.</div><div>So that's sort of the problem with direct response is like, you don't really know about delivery. So it's, it does pay to check because no, one's really revising their numbers downward. I will say like, Rooster teeth podcast one, they do do that. And I'm sure there are other networks that do advertise cast has done it before, but there are other networks and I don't want to save if I omitted it, that they're doing this, but there are other networks where I go, Hey, um, you're like 30% under and they're like, okay.</div><div>Ah, yeah. Well for you some bonus impressions and I go, you knew that this was going to happen. You didn't even like the guys texts back in 13 seconds. He doesn't go. Let me check on that. That's highly unusual. He just goes, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll give you two free ones and like, wait a minute. That was too easy.</div><div>You've known this as a problem before I signed on the dotted</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>line, but that's the thing. And I think me and you are digging into these same things and it's so interesting to see it on different sides, right? Like your sales. More sales and content focus with a technical side to it. I'm more technical vertice with a light content side to it.</div><div>We're exploring and examining the same thing that there are these holes that are just not worth these companies plugging, right. It is not in their benefits to update their documentation or better their numbers on that because it hurts them on their overall bragging rights. It feels like sometimes right.</div><div>You can't like, if you have to revise your numbers downwards, everybody's gonna dog pile on you. Right. You might end up in pod news. It's like, ah, 20% loss in downloads, but it's, but that's not the case. Right? It's still successful. It's still working. It's still all these things, but there's this gap and there's this gap that me and you are diving into in this space where it's just like, if every company gave one employee.</div><div>50% of their time to just look at this shit, to like really hands-on look at it and play with it. They would be masters of it. And because they aren't me and you are just like running around like two unsupervised kids. Sometimes we benefit greatly from it. But I think we're both of the mindset that we're like, we know more people need to know about this, so that everything's better.</div><div>Cause if, if everybody did what you were doing, The end result isn't that you can't keep doing this you to a little bit more on ads, but more advertisers are coming in immediately. If blue apron sat with you and was just like, learned from you for this stuff, then they're that third a hundred dollars they make off of the $3,000.</div><div>Right. They could make it even more. Right. They can expand that margin. And it's just, it's all about finding success is easy, right? And podcasting, there are enough tools there to know, is it a hit or is it a failure increasing the margin in success? That's, that's what this year and next year, and the, you know, this upcoming space has to be about because we're not going to get to a hundred percent fill anytime soon.</div><div>And we shouldn't because there should be more and more listeners. But we need to figure out how to provide more value. We need to make it efficient. That's why you can't buy from trade desk into a podcast ad and hope for success. That's why you have to meet us what this technology and content is.</div><div>Hands-on yeah,</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>I agree. I think this is a look I'm biased because I'm a podcaster, but yeah. I have tried ads for many things in many places. And I have a lot of friends that run companies and they're like, yeah, we do social media ads, but they're returning customers. They get way more from podcasts and they, their brand equity, like a company will say, oh man, you know, we, we can't put enough money into podcasts to keep our iPhone case business running.</div><div>Right. They have to sell like tens of thousands of these things probably per week or at least per month to make it a real multimillion dollar peripherals business. So there's not enough V they can't, they have trouble putting the money into podcasting, but then, so they'll test it with us. And they'll say like, eh, kind of worked kind of didn't, you know, it's good.</div><div>It's all other things being equal as good as social media, but I can put $2 million a month into social media. I can not put $2 million a month into podcasting and get this similar return. So it doesn't scale well, but then I'll see them six months later and they'll go, you know, it's funny. Everyone says, Hey, is that a such and such case?</div><div>I feel like I heard about that on a podcast and you're the only podcast that we bought. And I'm like, so all these people who saw it on Facebook, They remember hearing about it on the podcast, whether they saw it on Facebook or not as another question, but that's the, that's the impression that that lasted.</div><div>They don't go, Hey, I think I saw that in a random sidebar when I was looking at my ex-girlfriend from college. Right. They go, I heard Jordan talking about that on a podcast because it has bees on it or whatever. And so the advertising, like the, the impression on the podcast versus the impression on a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad, like these are not created equal and people will argue about this with me.</div><div>All the time, but I think we only have to look at the CPM, especially YouTubers. They're like, oh man, you know, th this podcasting is so hard. I get X thousand views on my YouTube. I get all these analytics and I go, what CPM do you get for your ad on YouTube? $3. They're like, yeah, I wish you know, or something like that for $10.</div><div>Yeah. It's like three bucks. Um, a buddy of mine is a really famous YouTuber, uh, travel YouTuber. And I think he's told me he makes between 20 and $80,000 a month on YouTube. Imagine how many impressions that is. And I go, okay, so what do you get for like a million views? And I thought he was going to tell me 20 grand or something like that.</div><div>Yeah. $2,500 if they're mostly U S and Canada viewers. And if they're not, it goes lower for a million views. So you have to constantly, and now it's like no wonder people be jumping off tables on a food and like prank, you know, like that's the stuff that can be used because you have to get millions of views just to, to pay your rent as a YouTuber every month on all your videos.</div><div>So these guys work like dogs, um, and, and we're bad is. With</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>podcasting. The reality is, is if you have a niche market and you are focused on it appropriately, and they are going to buy something, you could have an audience of a hundred people, dedicated people, and you could have an advertiser who sells products for companies that it's a hundred thousand dollars commitment.</div><div>And so if they've dropped four grand on you a month, that's nothing. If one converts. And so that's, that's why like people, like not only is it, the CPM is way higher, like you're saying, but like, Think outside the box, like the more interesting in nature content is like, the more you can just be like, Hey, this is what we are, and this is who we do.</div><div>And this is our audience and this is why we're different and unique. And I'm not here about the numbers. We'll share them with you, but like, we're not going to play that game. It's a sponsorship. And, and you can't do that in YouTube because they're going to be like, nah, I can, I, if you don't want to sell it, monetize the viewer</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>a hundred percent.</div><div>Yeah. I was going to say, look there. Before people go, wait a minute. You tubers can do, there are YouTube offers that will like say, Hey, Nord, VPN or something in their video, but you can only put one in. And that's like a 20 plus minute long YouTube video. I routinely put four or five ads in a podcast. I make them funny and no, I mean, no one complains.</div><div>Yeah. Sometimes people say. I've heard this ad for Netsweet so many times, and I go, Hey man, they bought a lot of ad. They're putting my kid through college, basically. That's what it is. But you know, you never really hear about that with, with YouTube, unless they're those automatic Google ads or whatever.</div><div>And then of course people can buy premium and then there's no ads. And so you're, you know, like there's a whole thing there podcasting really is special for that reason. And I love that it's sort of resist as a platform it's or as a, not a platform as a medium, it's resisted the whole. The thing that's ruined everything else.</div><div>Right? Giving away user data, making it creepy, being too invasive. Stopping in the middle of a damn sentence, it's a to play a musical ad for a Honda, a Hyundai, or like a, I don't know anything. Right. And you can do or get like, you could bust out an ad right now and we can riff on it and it would be a million times better and convert it three X the rate of a YouTube ad.</div><div>And it would be part of the show. And no one would complain. If you put three ads in a YouTube video. There are 8,000 comments that are like F U there's too many ads. I hate Jordan. You're ugly. And your head is fat. I mean, literally I will get that. You know, and they're not wrong about my head by the way, but that's sensitive subject.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Uh, yeah, but you're so right on it, the openness of people are like, ah, but there's no easy way to monetize, but, but it's, it's that you're all your own business, right? Every single podcast is their own business and you can take advantage of that. And that's to a benefit and a detriment. You don't want to do it yourself.</div><div>LA uh, be part of a bigger platform, right? Dive into something, sell your content. Work with Spotify, work with megaphone work with anchor, these partners, um, red circle, these people that will represent your inventory fully for you. And you don't have to think about it, but expect the lower CPM tube because there's more hands in it.</div><div>But if you're an entrepreneur, if you want to do this yourself, if you want to really make it a business like. You got to invest in as much money as you comfortably can to grow it. And you gotta realize that you're not entitled to it. So like you're not guaranteed a paycheck, you and your buddies talking about horror movies, probably not going to be enough to pay for your car.</div><div>So, you know, it's, I'm so happy that you're here. I think that I'm probably gonna ask you to come back at a later time with a Jack Rice header. I think we've talked about a little something on Twitter that would be fun to dig into. Um, but thank you so much for being here. The thing I like to end with, um, what is your most favorite podcast right now?</div><div>What are you what's consuming your time? You know,</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>it's funny, you should ask because I just subscribed. I never subscribed to new shows cause you know, you have too many, I don't even want to hear about new good shows. Cause I'm like, don't tell me. I'm going to end up subscribing. It's going to be a huge waste of time.</div><div>I accidentally subscribed to that one. I'm gonna delete that. I dropped my phone in the shower. My phone stopped playing the podcast. I was listening to subscribed somehow to another one and started playing it. And I'm like, that is a hell of a shake function. Um, I, which is what I assume happened. I don't understand how it's going to happen.</div><div>Uh, I am listening to pivot. With Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, because they're both so smart. And so their chemistry on air is really, really fun. Um, another show, since you only asked me for one, I'm gonna give you two, um, another show that I like recently, that's not something that literally everyone else listens to.</div><div>Is, oh, I was going to say the prof G show with Scott Galloway, but that's kind of a weird thing to do when I already have a Scott Galloway podcast. And then there's, um, there's behind the bastards. They're a little bit left leaning for me. I'm not leaning to the right, but these guys are like straight up, you know, there's a little, there's like extreme left.</div><div>Um, but he goes over the worst people in history, like obvious ones are Hitler and things like that, but he'll go over a lot of. Terrible people from Saddam Hussein to Jeffrey Epstein. And he does like a deep dive that's multiple hours long on each of these people. And he's quite funny. So that's fun, man.</div><div>Yeah. It's fun. It's so popular that show. I looked it up cause I thought, I can't believe more people don't know about this. And I went to buy ads on there and I was like, a lot of people know about this, like hundreds of thousands. I'm just late to the party.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>That's awesome. I'll have to check those out.</div><div>Well, thank you again for joining me and we'll talk to you more soon.</div><div><b>Jordan: </b>Thank you very much</div><div>and</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>stick around for some special bonus content. At the end of the episode, I've teamed up with Evo Terra to give you a minute long strategic thought that is guaranteed to shift your perspective on the present and future of podcasting.

I know that you&apos;re listening to sounds profitable because podcast ad tech is important to you. But it&apos;s important to me that you are kept up to date on the latest news from the entire podcast industry to help with that. Here&apos;s what happened last week. No matter when you&apos;re listening from James Cridlin at pod news.
Brands looking to advertise their podcasts are often told that host read ads. Aren&apos;t easy to scale, but sometimes the less easy paths provide the best results every month. Our guest Jordan harbinger of the Jordan harbinger show puts in considerable effort backed by tens of thousands of dollars to advertise his podcast.
On other podcasts. I wrote about this in my article, how to buy host, read ads at scale, which I&apos;ll link to in the description. Jordan has found amazing success with this strategy. And he was kind enough to share his knowledge on the subject with us, for the people who aren&apos;t familiar with you did you, you get into managing your ads, like the content creation.
You got a great idea. You you&apos;ve made your show, but like, What made you decide to not just have somebody else handle your ads?
Jordan: Well, first I did want to have somebody else handle my ads and I called friends of mine at agencies. Well, actually that wasn&apos;t even my first stop. I first started talking to people that worked in marketing at networks, and I said, Hey, do you ever freelance, you know, a little side hustle, a little kind of moonlighting.
Is there anything that I can do to hire you? And. I got a lot of yeses. And then like five months later, they wer...</itunes:summary>

To help with that. Here's what happened last week. No matter when you're listening from James Cridland at Podnews.</div><div>How do you know if your ad is working? Heck what is, is your ad even out there trying to do, I wrote an article about brand studies, which I'll link in the description, which talks about how best to track your ads effectiveness. For that article, I spoke to Tom Webster of Edison research with the hopes of getting a better grasp on what people need to know to get the best impact out of their campaign and how best to track that impact.</div><div>(music fades out, interview begins)</div><div>You know, it's so funny. I just got into like the, the event scene and the circus scene and had time to start watching the stuff that you were doing. Right. Like, I was a product manager at megaphone and really started to watch your stuff, but it's so hard to carve out time. And just as I started to dig more into this and just as I started to find more time, Everything went digital, right?</div><div>Everything went online rather instead of in-person I'm bummed because you, you run a good show with all the things that you guys do. Uh, and it's, I think it's such an important thing that people watch, like sort of to plug it at the beginning, like Edison research, just so many cool things. And I think the infinite dial is one of the most on biased views of audio.</div><div>And it has a great lens on podcasting and what. Listeners want and the crazy part about it is like, well, it's not easy stuff to do. And sometimes that's not data that like an advertiser or campaign wants to do. So you guys built this survey and research company that is doing the things that we need that we don't always like.</div><div>We can't always like put the bill to the advertiser. They're the things that people should be investing into. And growing because it just helps us all view the same landscape. It doesn't push any one specific narrative. Yeah. I</div><div><b>Tom: </b>mean, that's the thing, I'm not a, uh, podcast or who sort of dabbles in research.</div><div>I'm a 25 year survey researcher who loves podcasting and you know, we've been doing the infinite dial since 1998. It's still, I, I think the gold standard in terms of the, kind of the currency research that. Uh, podcasting looks at that streaming audio it looks at. And so on. It's done to the most ridiculous and ridiculously costly, uh, standards in survey research.</div><div>It's a, it's a telephone-based survey, which has a much, much higher response rate than anything online. It's over half mobile phone executed to match, uh, you know, statistics in the U S about who has mobile phones. And interestingly, and, and for years when I would tell people this, they would think it's funny.</div><div>And now they don't the most reliable statistics on the percentage of Americans who are mobile phone only who don't have landlines is owned by the CDC. The CDC tracks that every year, because they said, oh yeah. How to notify us if like, say there was, I don't know, pandemic, let's say so. Anyway. So just the costs alone on the infinite dial are nearly six figures.</div><div>I mean, it is, it is a bill that we write every year. Uh, but we continue to know that it is important to be the most reliable. Discerners of the present. I guess we leave forecasting to others to be able to put that out there and, and to where, you know, so that we can say, how big are these markets? Are these markets worth investing in?</div><div>And I, I like to think that we have done our part to help develop podcasting in terms of legitimizing it as a market for investment.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I completely agree with that in like also so much. Direct inspiration. I've taken from you guys too, to build what I'm doing. Right? What sounds profitable? Like your newsletter is your opinions about this great industry and topic and all of that.</div><div>And it's, it's great. It's very candid. It's very, you it's professional too, but like you make your, you you're Tom Webster and then the infinite dial, like you just said that this is a six figure report. That I don't have to sign up and give you like all my information necessarily. I don't have to pay for access to this report.</div><div>Every single sales deck that goes out there for podcast ad tech podcast, advertising is going to include slides from this. Everybody is going to be updating their sheets when this comes out. We're recording this right now in March. And you know, we're about a week away or week and a half away from the next infinite dial being released.</div><div>And the week after that heck even that weekend, people are going to be scrambling to update that and interpret the statistics that kind of tell their story. And that's so important, right? Like we can gate knowledge and learning and education and landscape views. Behind paywalls. And we can charge all these people here, but every single person in this space, or even looking at the space, you look at the state of, because it's freely available.</div><div>It's not bias. It's crazy expensive to put together. And I don't, I don't know. I find so much value for it. I'm such a fan boy, and I'm sure it's pouring through here because there's how many other companies can say they can do that. And you've been at Edison for how long.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Uh, I've been at Edison for this this'll be 17 years in June.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>And how old is Edison research?</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Total Edison research is, uh, 26 years old. So yeah, it was started in, uh, started in 94. And I joined really about a decade later, I think so. Right, right around in that, in that ballpark, I've been at Edison for one, I</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>can't imagine the amount of effort and focus. It took to be like, Hey, we're going to get all these statistics and then just give them away.</div><div>Right. And we need, we need to sponsors to come in to sponsor our research. You don't get to put your thumbprint on it. You can come help us talk through it, but it's our research that we're doing because you're able to sponsor us. And because we're doing all these things, but we're not going to charge the end-user like what?</div><div>That's a cool story. Right? And that's, we need more of that. We need more people to put out information to make it accessible to more people to come in and spend, or just be part of the industry.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Yeah. You know, I don't know if we're going to veer into content marketing or Bryan, but I, you know, the, the infinite dial for us is we started it in 98.</div><div>So this will actually be the 24th year of it. Technically, if you inclusively look at that and, and it's kind of always been this way, we've, we've spared no expense to make it as representative of the population as we can. And we've never gated it. We've never required signups or anything like that. You do sign up for the webinar, but you can just go to our website and get it.</div><div>And that's been an, you know, an interesting thing to convince people about we, one of the things that I'm kind of proud of about it, we want a content marketing award at content marketing world two years ago, uh, for, you know, for best use of original research. But to me, it's kind of one of the longest running content marketing exercises.</div><div>Uh, that's out there because one of the things that we've learned and we've experimented with different things that our goal. Is to equip as many people as we can with these data. And if we gate it, if we put a sign up on it, if we. You know, God forbid what you want to list to call you, to sell you something for you to download it.</div><div>You're not going to download it. You're not going to use it. And we will have wasted a whole lot of effort. I'm putting this out so we don't ever get it.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. And it's so hard, right? It's with the deep dives and with all the things that I've been doing with sounds profitable, talking to these partners that are sponsoring it.</div><div>Like I had to make a case for why, like, Hey, I'm not selling you an email list. I'll show you aggregate numbers. We'll show you the interesting stuff there. And I'm sure you guys do something similar. Like. For this one it's Triton that is, uh, sponsoring the 2021. And so that means that they're going to get some statistics of the people that watch the webinar.</div><div>I assume very high level nothing that they can go like call people about. But that branding is valuable. That means there's a year of content, a year of research that has their association with it, a webinar with one of their leaders on there, John Rosso. And that's, that's very cool. And that's all thought leadership stuff.</div><div>Yeah, and I was</div><div><b>Tom: </b>just gonna say, and Triton has been a magnificent partner for us for I've lost track now seven or eight years on this. It used to be Arbitron before, uh, Nielsen bought Arbitron and, and swallowed them up. But we've had Triton as a partner and, you know, an editorial partner they're very involved in the questionnaire.</div><div>They're very involved in helping make sense of the data. And, you know, it's been a really good relationship and, you know, John Roscoe and I think. We try to put on the best show that we can. I, I like John. So that helps you guys, or</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>you guys are pretty entertaining. Good voices between the two of you. He might have a little bit better background on the video though.</div><div>He's got that cool music set up.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Oh, he does. Yeah. And I'm going to try and have a good fakey fake background for the instrumental this year, but, uh, you know, John, John's a pro</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>yeah. It's so funny because I focused, I was like, oh, the podcasts are, sounds probably can't be like a promotion for anybody. And I want to really emphasize to people that, like, I am a fan boy of Tom and Edison, and they're what I'm modeling everything over.</div><div>This is like true, genuine endorsement because as I've talked to Tom more and more, and as he helped me with this article, You know, where I was a product manager for data and monetization, where megaphone, where I was with barometric and then Claritas with attribution and my roles as a commander and ad ops and stuff.</div><div>Edison research always came across as the company that just talked about the space, did all the crazy research at the top level. And more and more as I'm talking to Tom, what I'm realizing is they have tools for all of those levels of reporting available for people to use. Now. We default to Nielsen a lot in advertising because Nielsen has a big name and part of, I think the bad part of advertising technology and advertising is that once a name and a company gets so big, it becomes something that everybody just autopilot asks for.</div><div>And we don't tend to think about what we're going to do with it, right? Like you want a Nielsen study while the person asking for that? Honestly, probably doesn't know what that means. Necessarily. Someone above them ask for a form of validation. They picked it off of a list or the company has decided to standard, but that individual doesn't always know what they're looking for.</div><div>And so, you know, it's a big, important thing for me that more people know in this space, that's not just Nielsen. Addison has a product, uh, signal hill has a product. There are a bunch of companies out there that the prices vary across the board. I mean, Edison puts a lot of work and effort into this and they're customized products for campaigns like are, I think, appropriately priced, but the thing is, is.</div><div>Just call. If you're running a campaign, if you're doing anything in podcast, ad tech, podcast, advertising call all the partners, have all the conversations, understand their capabilities because there's unique stories there, you know?</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I, I so appreciate that. I mean, we are able to work with, uh, some wonderful ad tech partners, and I think, you know, what we do is very complimentary to that.</div><div>We're obviously very focused on the humans. Uh, on what the humans are doing when they're listening to podcasts, how the humans respond to both the content and to the messaging and the advertising. Uh, you know, our, we were able back in 2014 to launch a subscription-based product called share of ear, which gets quoted a lot in, especially in agency presentations and things like with media buyers and, you know, various agency platforms.</div><div>It's, it's the only single source measure of all audio in America. So it looks at both online and offline and expresses all of those different forms of audio devices, brands, all of that. As a share that percentage of the amount of time we spent listening to audio, that's devoted to a given medium or given brand and so on.</div><div>And that's a very brute force approach, right. We just throw thousands and thousands of bodies at it and literally, and, uh, and lots of people, uh, kind of coding very minute data responses to that. And knowing that, Hey, that was crazy. And B that it works. Uh, we applied the same model to podcasting really.</div><div>So we're able to do something very different, I think to what people that are measuring ad tech and also the download measures are providing. Which is essential by the way. I mean, this business doesn't run without downloads. Don't get me wrong, but rather than sort of look at things from the server out, we're able to look at things from the audience perspective and compare the two, you know, so we know from some of the companies, the ad tech companies out there.</div><div>Who's advertising the most, who's spending the most through impressions and things like that. We know on our end, what's getting through to people in terms of recall awareness, both from our podcast, consumer tracker, and also from the custom work that we're able to do. Uh, and you know, if there's any story that I would want to tell over and over in podcasting and Bryan, you know, this to be true.</div><div>It's that there's no secret sauce about being an ad on a podcast as opposed to some other medium, right? Yeah. A good ad is a good ad. A bad ad is a bad ad, a bad fit between a product and a message and a service and a show doesn't work. A good fit, works fantastically, and we're able to show that. And I think the reason why I'm such a passionate believer in what we do, not as a substitute for, but as it.</div><div>Uh, as something that rides right along with ad tech. Is that it a great podcast and a great podcast ad a great campaign put together has such a multiplicative effect on the power of a message that you don't get from banner ads. You don't get from almost any form of any form of digital advertising, frankly, when you, when you get it right.</div><div>And that goes well beyond an impression, it goes beyond. The change in the audience's willingness to consider a brand, their willingness to make a change in the supermarket, their willingness to visit a store they've never visited before. And those are the kinds of things that we think we measure as well as anybody.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. And that's, I think that's such an admirable thing about you and how you present this stuff is that you kind of lead the pack on like, Hey, this isn't complete. It is a well-researched well presented while bias identified view. And it adds to the total view and it helps people understand all sides of it.</div><div>I, I really think that you guys get the listener side amazingly. Right? I think it's so important. And I think that you're right. These other ad tech tools do get their side in other media channels. I mean, It always felt like that tech partner would come in and say our tools the best, and the answer is you're wrong.</div><div>Right, right out the gate. The fact that you said that you're wrong, there's no, unless I can touch the head of every single person who walks into the store and then ask them an exit survey of what they're buying and read their mind of all of their thoughts. Truthfully, there's nothing that's a hundred percent accurate for anything.</div><div>Right. And so what you've always done, and this is why I love your newsletter so much is that you will own the bias. You say, this is what it is. There is ways to get bad data, but most data collection is good. Presentation is important when you explain the biases of it, how you use it, what you're trying to do, you could take any data and bend it to your well and say, this proves my point.</div><div>But if you use these tried and true practices from the ad tech partners to the survey and research partners, to be that constant and that you let your data compare to that constant and show where it is in relation NATS, what is important? Right. We're I don't know. I feel like direct marketing is, is like very cool, but also like terrible because.</div><div>Someone's going to look at the price of that survey, or look at the attribution in podcasting, which can't get everything and just be like, well, on Facebook, I know every click and I know the exact dollar amount and like, that's neat, but it's not podcasting. There's a reason that mediums are different.</div><div>There's a reason you want to try it. So, yeah. I like, I like the ownership that you guys are not saying that this is right. You're just saying this is well-researched and here's how we present it.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Everything has a margin of error, you know, and, and we've been the sole providers of the exit polls for the networks during the elections, since 2003 people will sometimes denigrate survey research, I think, cause they, I either, Hey, they don't understand it or B they think I can do it myself.</div><div>Cause there are self service tools out there. I can guarantee you that if you tried to do the exit, polls yourself with, you know, whatever. You, you might make some mistakes and, and we've never had a client miss projector race, you know, and I've said this before. I think what survey research, what good survey research produces aren't guesses, they're estimates and estimates look, sound and behave within certain parameters.</div><div>Most of the time they're plus or minus, you know, in our podcast, consumer tracker they're plus or minus one, except in a very extraordinary circumstances. And we're experienced enough to spot those. So, you know, we believe very passionately what we do. And I, I think. You know, ad tech is, is extraordinarily important in legitimising podcasting as a bucket for brands to put their dollars because that's because those are the buckets they're used to putting money into and podcasting's bucket has to look very similar to those other buckets.</div><div>Or it's, or it's not going to get the duckets in, in those buckets. I guess I just made that up. Uh, that's one thing, but the other side of the coin though, is, you know, though, we are audio only dear listeners. I can see Bryan right now, uh, is that the new shore microphone? It shares the MV seven, the MV seven, right?</div><div>When I get done with this, I'm going to, I'm going to Google that cause you sound really good. And I'm going to look that up and guess who's going to get the attribution for that Google. Uh, there's, there's going to be a search with no other breadcrumbs attached to it. And, you know, I might search for it.</div><div>It might show up as an ad. Maybe I'll click on the first ad for it. Instead of the organic searches. I don't know all of these things will happen, but it's, but Bryan Barletta is the one who should get the credit for it because I heard him use it and it sounded good. And so that's the dimension that we're trying to add, which I think really shows that the true value of a great marriage, between message.</div><div>Medium and creative that you can get from the best podcast ads. Yeah.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>There, honestly, and we need to be more honest about it as an industry. There's holes in podcasts, ad tech, like there is a knowledge gap. I think there are a lot of people in the management and leadership positions that are not doing the right job to empower the people under them, to educate them, to give them time to do it.</div><div>And it's not because they're like malicious it's because there's not a lot of time. There's a new campaign coming. There's a new idea. We're all rushing, rushing, rushing, like. The idea that everybody got their commute time back. That was cute for the first like two months. But like now everybody's working through it or, you know, sleeping at the office as much as they are working from home effectively a megaphone.</div><div>It was really important for us to get data and use data and have a megaphone, which was well-funded and well taken care of. Like, we still looked to other partners for it because you have to own and accept that. Like, yeah. Cool. You can hire a few people internally and it might save you some bucks, like.</div><div>In the near term, but that's like a whole another line you have to do. It's okay. For things to be specialized. It's okay. To work with other partners on stuff. Heck the stuff that you're talking about with Shira veer, that research, that identification, that plus or minus value, these ad tech companies can take that data and work with you directly for custom solutions if they wanted to.</div><div>And now they can say not only is our control file, uh, indicative of the podcasters that we listened to or that we experienced, like pod sites. For example, there. The control file is built just off of podcast listeners, but they could also layer in some learnings from your data to improve it further, right?</div><div>Like there is a collaborative nature, all this, there is no shame in saying you can't do everything. There is no shame in not having it in house. And I don't think that most companies should have all these tools in-house because then it's great in your own homework. Like if a Spotify starts doing their own surveys and their own, uh, attribution tracking, like.</div><div>At the end of the day, like, are they going to tell me when it's bad? Like maybe legally, because they're a publicly traded company, but am I going to have that doubt in my head? Definitely. Right. That's just how people work. So working with these third parties is really important. You had talked about this before.</div><div>We, we dug into it a little bit, but like surveys are so important on every level, right? Like, and, and everybody with a podcast, like let's, let's just take advantage of it here. Bryan@soundsprofitable.com with an IRA. Why Tom, what putting you on the spot? What are like three questions that my audience should send me answers to?</div><div>That would be valuable for me as a podcast</div><div><b>Tom: </b>or. Yeah, but that's a great one. You are putting me on the spot. I'm going to give you a couple though. Okay. Here's here's, here's one of my favorites. If you were to walk into, do you know the Dewey decimal system, Bryan Bennett to a library library.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I haven't been in a library in a long time, but, uh, growing up in Massachusetts, that was something that they definitely made sure we learned in school.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Hundred percent. Yeah. And I'm in Boston right now, but not very far from the central Boston public library, which is sadly still shuttered. But a really good question. I think to ask your listeners is if I walked into the, into the great, the, you know, the grand library of Alexandria, where all of the podcasts are stored, what section of the library would they find you in?</div><div>Oh, that's a really good question to ask people, I think, and, and really kind of drill down in that. That's one question I'd like to ask. I'm going to give you, I think my three favorite questions. I'm going to give you this gold content, right? Question number two. Um, is, do you think the show is popular?</div><div>This is a question I ask all the time when I'm doing qualitative research for, for, I do a lot of qual research actually for, uh, for some of the larger podcast networks, testing, new show ideas, and, you know, even, uh, doing some listening studies of existing programming. And one of the questions I like to ask people is, do you think this is a popular show?</div><div>I think people like to show, and then that sort of puts that out of, you know, you can, you can very easily say, oh, I like it. It's good. I don't know. It's cool. And stuff like that. That's not incredibly helpful. Yeah. Uh, you know, move, move the box outside of their skull a little bit and ask them, do you think people like this, you think this is a popular show or not?</div><div>Uh they'll. They will start to go down different paths. And then my, uh, my all-time favorite question is I call it the eulogy question. If sound's profitable were to die tomorrow, we're just to go away. I'm sorry, Bryan. I killed it. Oh no. What would you miss the most? And people can, can be somewhat more eloquent in describing what they would miss.</div><div>Then they can't be talking about the positives that they like. We're much more equipped as humans with, uh, to be articulate about the negative than we are articulate about the positive, our vocabulary for the positive. Is very limited too. I like it. It's good. I love it and stuff. Uh, but if you ask somebody what they don't like about something, prepare for the dictionary, it's why Twitter exists.</div><div>That's why Twitter exists. And I, and I find that if you sort of put a negative frame, not negative as, and I'm bringing you down, but if I were to take something away, what would you miss the most then? You'll, you'll actually get some responses that maybe you weren't expecting, uh, when you sort of pursue things from a, what do you like about this, this current thing they might give you what they, you know, yeah.</div><div>So anyway, there you go, going to give you three questions.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>What we're going to do is I'm going to put those in the show notes and I'll put my email in there for people to contact. And then another thing I learned from you is you can't ask something of your audience without giving them something. So anybody who fills out the survey.</div><div>And also gives me their address. I'll mail them a sound's profitable stickers that we just got, uh, as a thank you for your towel. There we</div><div><b>Tom: </b>go. Right? Yeah. It's you know, to me, anytime you get genuine listener feedback, it's a gift and you may not agree with it. It may objectively be wrong, but it's a gift because someone the time, and to me, if you're going to ask for that kind of feedback to genuinely make the show better.</div><div>I think a you should, you should offer some kind of an incentive and I've actually got a big, long article. Um, probably not this week's newsletter, but maybe a couple of newsletters from now where I'm going to talk about a lot of this, that you should find a way to express your things, whether that's with an exclusive piece of content, some stickers, you know, it's really hard to do B2B podcast research for B2B podcasts, all audiences, right.</div><div>But a donation to a cause that is relevant to that, to that community can, can help and things like that. So it doesn't always have to be cash and sometimes cash is really. Off-brand it always works, but that may not be the right call, but at least it says I'm going to do something with this. And then on the flip side, when you do get that feedback and you do do something with it, don't keep that a secret continually.</div><div>Talk about that with your listeners, that thanks so much for the surveys you guys filled out three months ago, four months ago, we're introducing a new feature this week. And really this came from feedback from you. Keep it alive. Keep people aware that. They are part of the show. And that's, I think a way to sort of link your, your survey research with your marketing in a way that doesn't compromise the survey research.</div><div>It just says, thank you for your feedback where you're using it. You are helping the show. What you did was not in vain. We used it.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah, no, that's I think that's so important feedback. People taking the time to put that out there. I know of a certain three letter organization in advertising technology that a lot of people send feedback into and they didn't even acknowledge it.</div><div>So I'll tell you getting a thanks for sending this in great points. We'll talk about it more and get back two and then hearing or seeing like pain from that. It makes people feel good. Yeah. And it makes them feel part of the community, like you said, and then they talk about, got it more right. I've received some feedback.</div><div>I'm actively working on it. Based on the fact that this might not come out immediately. I don't want to say any of it here. I'll do it with dynamic ad insertion later, but it's so great. And I want to reward that. I want to send these people stickers because that's what I have available. I could shout out their names.</div><div>I could do so many different things than I will. Um, And I think that's really powerful and a great note to end on, you know, everybody should really check out Tom Webster dot sub stack.com to follow Tom's newsletter, tons of great information for any level of podcasts or anybody in the industry. Uh, it is one that I don't miss.</div><div>And now I am so thankful that you did in podcast form because now I have even less of an excuse to not listen to it or read it immediately. And then the infinite dial at Edison research. Um, by the time people listen to this, the 2021 will be available, uh, in both video form and the PowerPoint as well.</div><div>Uh, and I hope everybody, you know, digs into that finds tons of value from it. And in the same way that I'm asking for feedback, Chu, Tom and Edison research your questions, like they want to hear that and they want to know how they can work with you. And yeah, you're a part of this industry too. So. Tom. So glad to have you here.</div><div>Final question. I'm gonna put you on the spot with what is a podcast you're listening to lately. That's not super mainstream.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>Uh, I love the 20,000 Hertz podcast and I know it's, it's, it's not, um, but I'm, I'm incredibly appreciative of the work that goes into it. The sound design that goes into it, the amount of research that goes into it.</div><div>So. That's when I, I, I rarely miss. I also, I listened to curiosity daily every single day with, uh, with my wife. I love that one. And I want to just real quick, shout you out, Bryan, because the work that you're doing with dynamic ad insertion in creative ways in your own show is I think shining a beacon to what it can be.</div><div>A lot of times when people talk about dynamic ad insertion, they're talking about the. Uh, the remnants of a failure of the imagination, and I commend you for the imagination you're putting into it. And she might ask you that what, what it can do. So, yeah.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Thank you. Thank you. I'm excited for a world where people can get to carve out a few hours a week and mess around with these tools.</div><div>The people that are way more creative than me, because I'm just like, oh, well I can say something different per country. And there are way smarter people out there that can do cool stuff. So thank you. Thank you for that compliment. That means a lot coming from you. And I'm so happy to have you here and I'll hopefully I'll have you back.</div><div><b>Tom: </b>No doubt. Thanks Bryan. Thanks.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Cheers.</div><div>(upbeat acoustic music fades in)</div><div>and stick around for some special bonus content.

I know that you&apos;re listening to Sounds Profitable because podcasts ad tech is important to you, but it&apos;s important to me that you are kept up to date on the latest news from the entire podcast industry. To help with that. Here&apos;s what happened last week. No matter when you&apos;re listening from James Cridland at Podnews.
How do you know if your ad is working? Heck what is, is your ad even out there trying to do, I wrote an article about brand studies, which I&apos;ll link in the description, which talks about how best to track your ads effectiveness. For that article, I spoke to Tom Webster of Edison research with the hopes of getting a better grasp on what people need to know to get the best impact out of their campaign and how best to track that impact.
(music fades out, interview begins)
You know, it&apos;s so funny. I just got into like the, the event scene and the circus scene and had time to start watching the stuff that you were doing. Right. Like, I was a product manager at megaphone and really started to watch your stuff, but it&apos;s so hard to carve out time. And just as I started to dig more int...</itunes:summary>

Here's what happened last week. No matter when you're listening from James Cridland at Podnews.</div><div>It's a bit technical, but they're an intrinsic part of understanding how effective your advertisements are. There's a bunch of different methodologies for using them and I've detailed them at great length. And the two-part article on linking in the description in trying to help explain this as best I could.</div><div>I spoke to Matt Drengler from Podsights, a great friend and colleague for too many years about his extensive knowledge in the field of lift reports and attribution. So me and Matt have had a long history together. We were a part of the founding team of barometric that was acquired by Claritas, and it's still kicking around in the attribution space, big fans of theirs as well.</div><div>And Matt helped me a lot with my two part series on understanding lift reports because Lyft reports is an extension of campaign. Attribution are really important right there. The pretty visual at the end of it, that can be used to optimize the campaign or. Honestly for a lot of you out there that hopefully will find value.</div><div>And it's the type of thing that you send to the brand, or you send to your boss to say like, Hey, thumbs up. We did good. So, you know, Matt, let's, let's go over a few, like quick definitions here to make sure everybody's up to speed. So how would you define the attribution in podcasts? Advertising attribution</div><div><b>Matt: </b>very simply put is the act of identifying if podcast media exposures is driving a conversion or whatever the KPI or key performance indicator is for that particular</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>advertiser.</div><div>Cool. So this, this podcast, we have ads on here. And if, you know, we mentioned like, Hey, check out Podsights.com. If there's a pixel in here, what it's doing is it's grabbing your IP address and it's trying to identify as much as it can about that and match that for the exposure. And then there's a pixel on the Podsights website.</div><div>So when you visit there, it's trying to learn as much about your visit there as well, match it to a device graph and try and link the two to say the person who visited the website definitely was the person or even the household more likely. That listen to the act. Right,</div><div><b>Matt: </b>exactly. Right. And what you're describing now is pixel based attribution.</div><div>Right? Originally, when we talk about just general podcast attribution, I would argue that that those terms include the, how did you hear about us survey, the vanity URL, the coupon code, and things like that, which, you know, to be very transparent on how we feel about that at Podsights, then I would argue everybody else in the pod, the pixel based attribution space feels, um, is that the vast majority of advertisers, that's just not good enough.</div><div>Um, I know we hear a lot of. I would say chatter around this idea of, Hey, like 75, 80, 85% of people that convert actually fill out that, how did you hear about a survey? And then the next question is like, but do you believe what they said? And that's always, my biggest question is if I'm scrolling through the thousand or so shows that exist on some of these, how did you hear about us surveys?</div><div>Is my finger going to get tired? I'm just gonna stop and click on whatever am I going to find a show that I really like. That I want to give the credit and just select that and then move on. Or did I actually hear the ad on that show? And then like another thing to call out is do we, as humans even fully understand what it is that drove us to purchase?</div><div>That's that's the biggest thing. Like I bought a new microphone recently. Don't I sound nice. And what's the reason that I bought this microphone because I gave you a shift for it. Cause you get okay. That's reason number one. Right. But like how much credit do I give the shit that you gave me? Should I give that the full credit or was it also the ads that started to hit me as I looked for the best and easiest microphone to use?</div><div>Um, and so there's all these different things that from a human psyche perspective, I don't think we always know what drove us to buy and what is causing us to do things it's not always very cut and dry. And so, um, that's why I think pixel based attribution specifically is what gets around that bias. Uh, you always made fun of me for saying this Barletta, but like it's this guy go guy.</div><div>Go. Exactly. Garbage in garbage out, no matter how good your methodology is or your math is to derive the answer. If the data going into that analysis is garbage, then the data coming out is garbage. I</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>super agree what I want to set up for everybody here is that me and Matt worked like hand in hand for five years ago.</div><div>So the people, the people who are used to talking to me or listening to the podcast and hear me go on a tangent and go there. Well, you just saw for Matt, like imagine five years of working closely together. And they're two of us tangenting. Like, it was a lot of fun. We got a lot of cool things done, but sometimes we even needed a translator.</div><div>Yeah, absolutely. You know, man, I love working with you on all this stuff, because like, when we think of the split, like your sales with a lot of tech and I'm tech with some sales, right. And it's always worked really well. There you went all of that. You covered so many different things. We've covered non pixel attribution.</div><div>We covered, uh, the, the access schedule side of it, the, uh, the survey and the mental and the psychology side. Of that, which I'm probably going to sit on for a little bit. I got Tom Webster on at some point who could probably answer a little bit more there for both of us, but like, you're right. Like when we think about the surveys, like there are a lot of people out there that are very pro surveys and profanity or Alison pro.</div><div>Coupons, you know, I don't think that they're bad. I think that none, no attribution. And my point of view is a hundred percent accurate. It can never be a hundred percent accurate, right? Because even if you're talking directly to a human they're walking into your physical store, you get in their way before they come in or they're at the counter and he looked them in the eye.</div><div>Like they can lie to you. So. You know, I think that I look at these lower tech options of the vanity URL and the, uh, coupon code, and they have a lot more room to be scammed. Right. But I constantly look on coupon sites when I'm going to buy something to see something's out there. And there are coupon codes for podcasts stuff all the time and the band, the URLs and everything, because it is in that benefit of that publisher or the services out there to make those available to more people.</div><div>So there is a little bit more Roman it's way, lower tech to S. Kim knows. So it's not that like, they're not completely valuable. It's just that they have a higher margin of error,</div><div><b>Matt: </b>actually the best part about the scamming thing. And I don't mean to interrupt you sometimes advertisers scammed themselves because they'll have an offer that's out there with a podcaster.</div><div>That's like, yo get 15% off. And then you go to the homepage or the advertiser and the homepage has a 20% off coupon on the homepage. And it's just sort of like when you sit there and you look at that and you go, why would anybody ever use the podcast coupon? Yeah. Why. And now, and now you've completely destroyed any possibility of like looking at any results that this podcast could have driven, let alone something getting posted to a coupon code site or like, you know, via honey, which now I don't know if you've heard about this, but a lot of it, you don't actually have to search coupon code sites, just click a button with a Chrome extension, and now it just.</div><div>Pops a coupon code,</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>right. Until honey starts sponsoring. We don't give them too much credit on here. No, but I mean, it's a cool thing. No, but you're, I mean, like you're super right with that. Like I was just talking to someone the other day about the fact that like marketing and the marketing team and the advertising team are very different teams.</div><div>Right? Like. They don't always communicate in the same way. So the people that are handling those deals on the website are not necessarily the people that are cutting the deals with these podcasts and advertisers. So that 20% on the site might make sense today, but it's super under cuts that 15% and it just makes the campaign look useless.</div><div>Now, again, pixel base, when we look at it right now, there is a massive hole with cellular and business. IP addresses, almost shirtless everything's household, where. Fortunate, I guess for ad tech, who awful to say that in the world of, uh, the panel, like most things are happening on a home wifi connection.</div><div>My phone yells at me every night when I try, like I'll disconnect from my phone and I'll be like, don't worry, I'll reconnect at midnight. And I was like, Okay. Okay. Thanks. I didn't know I wanted that, but we're there. I think, yeah. Most podcasts downloads happen when you're connected on wifi connections. If you're doing a download, if you're streaming on Spotify or other services, like yeah, it's missed.</div><div>But, uh, enough of those downloads, I think I'm comfortable saying enough. Downloads and podcasting and enough streams in podcasting, ham in the household that these numbers for attribution can be directional. And I don't, I don't really want to go into it because I think that it is a massive amount of effort and it's fear-mongering that there are ways to scam impressions and downloads, but we're talking like tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in investments for it to be a noticeable thing or an uncatchable thing.</div><div>And so at the end of the day, like, Putting a pixel on, uh, when the media is served and putting the pixel on the website and calling that a day as good enough for directional is fantastic. If you are counting and you're saying I only got 10 conversions, you're looking at it the wrong way. And that's where we get into lift reports, which is this whole idea is that that 10 conversions isn't accurate.</div><div>And we know it's not accurate going into it because it doesn't catch everything. So what that means is that with the lift report, which I'd like you to explain what it is. We're able to see, like what, what is the actual picture? What does that tend 10 mean in the landscape of how the performance of the site was already doing?</div><div><b>Matt: </b>Yeah, exactly. I mean, th the overly academic way to talk about Lyft's studies is, um, it isolates the impact of the campaign that you're measuring with the lift study. And the reason that that's important, think about any large brand that spends tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars in the advertising ether.</div><div>As it were and those individuals are, or those individual brands are working really hard to figure out like, which of these marketing channels or, or publishers or tactics are driving the best results. And they're all spending a metric crap ton. That's a scientific term that metric crap, ton of money bringing all of this data in as much as they can into a, an MTA provider multitouch attribution provider or a media mix modeling, uh, would say organization or company.</div><div>And trying to figure out what is working. And the reality of it is, is getting those types of data feeds, set up is really challenging. And using that type of data with the actual algorithm is challenging. I distinctly remember, and I go back and we'll get back to list studies. But like, I go back to my time when I was at staples and we spent a lot of time bringing in a multitouch attribution provider and we had to stop once and go to a different provider based on the results that we're seeing.</div><div>It took a year to get to a point where we knew we didn't want to work with the first one and we wanted to go work with the other one. And so that amount of time means it's really challenging to get any channels, new channels into this mix and even really interpreting it. Right. Because now you start to talk about like, Well, podcasting is at the household level.</div><div>And display is at the individual level. And how do you account for that within your actual algorithms? And so it's lifts studies that allow you to basically get those results without having to plug all of that data in, into your multi-touch attribution provider. Here's what that means. If I'm a very large company spending tons of money in this space, I've got, I don't know, direct mail live display, live billboards, live insert your favorite channel here.</div><div>Right. They want to know. Okay. But like all of the conversions that I just saw take place for podcasting, like how many of those would have happened anyway, because I have so much other marketing out there that's live. And a lift study is designed to answer that because you create a control group. Now we're going to dive into that a lot where we create a control group and we observe how this control group behaves organically.</div><div>And the idea of a control group is one it's about mutually exclusive group of individuals compared to the exposed group or the people that are actually being hit by these podcast ads. And the activity that this control group is exhibiting on the website is. The assumption is, well, that's a result of all of the other marketing channels that are out there, that's driving that activity.</div><div>So if I can see what that baseline activity looks like, then I can subtract that from the results that I see from the exposed group. And then the difference between what the control group is doing and the exposed group is doing that is the isolated impact of the podcast campaign. Again, just removing all of the other channels.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. And, and so I want to rewind just a little bit. Yeah, I think that you're right. Like I think that first off the lift reports are the right way to go for people who are getting ready to get up and run. Right. I think that if you have a smaller team or if you heck, if you are only allowed to focus on podcasting or if your, you don't have, yeah.</div><div>You don't have the reach to the other channels, you don't have the time you want to get something up and running. You want to prove it. Let's study is the only answer podcast based lifts study. In my opinion is the only answer because it just removes reliance on anyone. But you. Right. As a brand, you control everything.</div><div>It's a pixel on the website. It's a pixel on the campaign. And what you're looking for is does this strategy work is the strategy podcasting in general. Cool. Probably too broad. You're going to get a yes, that's fine. Is it the states you want to do one by state, maybe a little too aggressive, unless your spends there, maybe it's by demographic targeting, maybe it's by all these different things, but that lift report is going to let you answer as quick as possible with his little reliance on anybody else.</div><div>Does this work right now? Multi, multi touch attribution, like Matt said, is the, the mindset of that. The same company measuring everything are measuring the podcast. One is going to measure everything and you know, you you've painted in a, in a picture like, um, is the overlap worth it? Like I got my catching these people on podcasts that I'm already catching somewhere else.</div><div>And, um, I want to give a little bit of credit, the people in the touch space, you know, uh, have justified and shown that like, it's not only about just like, is there overlap, but does that overlap help? Right? Do I need four impressions in podcasting for a conversion or is it for impressions across all media and mold?</div><div>I think multi touch is great. I mean, Heck to be super fair. Me and you like fought for it for like four years at barometric, a thousand percent trying to make a little bit. And the reason that it didn't happen was that nobody who wanted to buy the product could affect it that much change.</div><div><b>Matt: </b>Correct. And it's not only that.</div><div>I agree with you that the outcome or the output. Of multi-touch attribution is insanely valuable. Yes. But the question is, is the work involved to get it set up worthy of the time and effort? Because again, after you set this up and start receiving some outputs, the next question you have to ask yourself is, is this believable, like.</div><div>And defensible, and then you have to start poking and prodding and testing that out rhythm to be like, are the results sort of expected as they should be? Almost like you're creating a test that, you know, the end result for to see if the algorithm agrees with you. And that right there is what</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>takes a lot of time.</div><div>You're right. Basically the companies that will get the most value about multi-touch attribution are the companies that take three months to sign a basic contract. Right. And that's, it's very clear there. And what I can say is that if you're exploring multi touch attribution, you should be at a company that has your own internal data science team.</div><div>I don't mean like one nerd who likes to look at data like me and Matt. I mean like a true team that can go through it. And you probably don't care about any of the platforms you use as internal analytics. You get the raw data and formulate it yourself. That's the people that multi-touch is for. It has immense value, but like Matt said, when you are one person or a small team or trying something out or trying to prove, should we go from spending $50,000 to $500,000 to $5 million?</div><div>Like you. We'll spend more time and money setting up MTA. MTM might be an evolution of something you do. It might be at a later point in maturity, but podcasting is still in the advertising space, in the infancy. And the fastest way to test an idea is a left report. You did, you meant Chyna media mix modeling.</div><div>And that's one thing that me and you've talked about a little bit, but I'd love for you to explain the differences between that and MTA, if you don't mind, that's more of a report, right? That's less of like an actual. Like tracking the full campaign in real time and seeing the results. It's more of like an end result.</div><div>Like here's your scorecard. Yeah.</div><div><b>Matt: </b>Multitouch attribution is typically a custom attribution methodology. Whereas media mix modeling is typically some form of aggression. I I'll start to. Like go to a place where I don't know as much because I haven't actually done the calculations for media mix modeling before.</div><div>Um, but the biggest difference that I have heard and have seen personally in my time, especially at staples, is the speed with which these reports come out. So multi-touch attribution will typically, if not, real-time might be a daily or a weekly update, media mix modeling is typically something where it would require.</div><div>A month or longer worth of number crunching and data collection in order to create the output. And more often than not what you're doing is you're seeing the output. Six seven weeks after the measurement period has ended. So one of the biggest complaints, and I believe one of the biggest reasons that MTA exists is media mix modeling is really not immediately actionable.</div><div>Like if I see for instance, right? Like my back to school season, Really didn't seem to do well for, for one channel versus another. I can't react to that with media mix modeling fast enough, because back to school's over and I just received the report for it. Whereas MTA, I have an opportunity to actually see that information in front of me within a decent amount of cadence.</div><div>And, and react to it. So that's, that's the biggest difference</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>between the two, you know, that's a great idea back to school season and things like that. I'm typically of the mindset that Facebook and other mediums have driven us to this belief that we need to be able to see that sale in real time, on a one-to-one basis.</div><div>Oh, boy, does it suck dealing with people who have that anxiety coming over from Facebook into podcasting and like even 48 hours or a week is enough for them to like literally drive you up a wall. Um, but, uh, you're right. There are some seasonalities of things that are really important. And so, you know, being able to at least see something super comprehensive on a weekly basis, like a lift report or every two weeks or every month, um, being able to see the attribution on a daily basis, that you can make a gut call on.</div><div>Um, these are things that are really powerful because podcasting, you know, you can be flexible and you can change it. You can change budget from different, especially if you're, if you're targeting by like unique characteristics of a listener, you can change that. Day to day, if you want you shouldn't, you gotta get enough data.</div><div>You gotta get like a week of data before you heal. And we like</div><div><b>Matt: </b>to say, you wait three to four weeks before you make any changes or optimizations to your campaign, you need to have a critical mass of data. It's, it's very easy to, to, to react to data that looks like you need to react to it immediately, but then like, yeah, but your last optimization was like yesterday.</div><div>So give it a little bit of time. Yeah. Um, so that's, that's definitely something that we,</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>the lift reports they're very cool because like, There's a whole in education and understanding in ad tech in general. And I'm seeing it a lot in podcasting. And the truth is, is that those of you in like the lower end roles, like the account manager, ad ops, operations, sales, and all that, like you are some of the most knowledgeable people at your company, like the decision makers, your managers, the people above, you know, what you've passed on to them?</div><div>No, it has surface, they don't know the hands-on, they should, and they kids. Right. And I hope that they start spending more time on it. But, um, one of my favorite advantages of something like Lyft report is you can take a screenshot and you can send that to your boss because the biggest account management tip I ever learned was nobody opens your attachments.</div><div>If they have to open your attachment, they're probably pretty frustrated with you. So if you can tell them success in a screenshot in the actual body of the email, like you are their favorite person. So Lyft reports help there and, you know, It's it is. If you set up your lift report, if you set up an attribution campaign too broad, right?</div><div>One pixel for all of your podcasting endeavors, like he might not see success, but if you get granular, right, if you do it by the strategies, like we talked about, you're going to see both success and failure. And Matt, me and you, we spent a lot of time when that, that was the hardest one, because we would get these people on the phone who were like my job's on the line.</div><div>Like, I don't know how to, how to tell you this. Like this was supposed to be successful and it's not going in the direction we want. And I have to explain this to my boss and like, I'm ready to pull this money out and go to Facebook. Like, what are the things that you tell somebody who's freaking out because they don't have a positive lift report in.</div><div>The percentage that, you know, the baseline or industry standard was, or like a neutral or a negative, if you want to go through each of those that I think that could be a really empowering thing to hear for these people who have to defend those. Yeah.</div><div><b>Matt: </b>I mean, if I, if I see something that is negative, There's a few ways to go with that.</div><div>So, first off, if we're talking about a very, very large advertiser there, they're in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billion dollar range, and they put $50,000 into podcasting. There is no chance that you're going to achieve incrementality. You're spending so much damn money elsewhere, that there is no doubt that that $50,000 is being cannibalized by your TV and your print.</div><div>And your banner and your paid social, Andrew retargeting, Andrew, yada, yada yada. And so your favorite channel here. So that, from my perspective, if I'm talking to a very large brand and they don't achieve any incrementality on a small test, my immediate reaction is, yeah, but like, if you were dipping your toes into TV, now this is a little bit ridiculous because podcasts is not TV, but like, just to be grandiose to make the point, if you are going to be dipping your toes into TV, how much would you spend.</div><div>And if they start coming back with million multimillion dollar numbers, and I'm saying there is no way that $50,000 is going to overachieve. Or achieve over and above what you're spending on TV, then</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>you there, because like, let's take logic out of this situation because unfortunately that person who came in with that $50,000 campaign for that billion dollar spend company is like three steps removed from the person who like actually cut the budget.</div><div>So they don't have the authority that 50 K campaigns coming through. That is a negative lift, but like, we all understand it, right. That, that. The specific brand that me and you are dancing around right here, as an example is very clearly like a household name. Everybody knows it it's every brand that I've gone to.</div><div>So if they're one of the 250 people who are not my mom listening to this podcast, maybe they'll give me a call about this and yell at me. But like the end of the day, like there are hustled name. That's it's so saturated. So they get a negative lift on that end. What, w what do you tell them? Because they didn't want to hear you at the first part where you're just like, Hey, This, this is a drop in the ocean.</div><div>This isn't enough. You are so well known that I could run this, this exposure pixel on a podcast that doesn't even have your ad and get similar results. Yeah. So what do you tell them on that? You get that report back in his name? So, so,</div><div><b>Matt: </b>um, the first thing that I remind them, Is just by adding attribution to something does not mean it's going to be successful.</div><div>So keep in mind what a third party attribution provider is doing. It is giving you based on all of its knowledge of this campaign, as much information as it can to tell you in an unbiased way,</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>what happened are you telling me that I, when I pay the CPM to you, it's not for you to justify my decision and say that.</div><div>Yeah, Bryan, your idea was successful. I don't cut a check to Podsights to be like your ideas perfectly, what I'm telling you, bring logic into it. And that's great. I</div><div><b>Matt: </b>throw logic out the door,</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>but I decided against it, but that's true, but people need to hear that. So many times people are there like attribution and, and lift reports.</div><div>It's just to justify your point of view. Like you're</div><div><b>Matt: </b>paying me, you're paying me to tell you if this shit worked. And if I tell you it worked, and then you start diving deeper into the data and you're like, man, this didn't work. Then what I, what am I supposed to say? What am I supposed to like be, oh yeah, you're right.</div><div>No, you're right. I wonder what happened there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like I have to be honest with you on what worked and what didn't. So anyway, back back to the question, right? So, so very large advertiser. My answer to this is true for a very large advertiser, but also let's say a medium to smaller size advertiser that doesn't have as much spend out there in the marketing world.</div><div>Which is just by looking at the overall lift study results. It is a great, like wet finger in the air. Did this work or didn't this work, but the, the job of an attribution provider from my perspective, and I carry this throughout our time working together, Bryan, and throughout the time that I've been here at Podsights, and I would argue that every attribution provider should, should think this way, our job is to tell you, okay.</div><div>But yeah. What, like, what next, what am I supposed to do with this information? Because if I don't, if I'm just telling you success or not success. There's nothing. There's nothing I can do with that. So the way to look at lift results is by breaking them down into the relative performance, relative lift. So within a singular campaign, like we've been talking about before, there's going to be individual line items or tactics or shows that you're going to be, um, uh, that you're gonna include in this plan.</div><div>Right? And so if I take a look at a lift study and I break it down by those line items, by those placements, by those shows. Then I can start to see sort of the building blocks of that lift study. And it can start to identify, here are the pieces that showed incrementality and here are the pieces that were not incremental at all.</div><div>So now you've got almost like a breadcrumb trail that tells you go do more of. A go do less or completely divest from B. And now you have your next step, which is</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>go do that. That's certain, and that's so killer because the amount of companies that come to you and are just like, Hey, here's our go-to, here's where we always target go do the same thing in podcasting.</div><div>And like podcasting is different. Right. We have to treat it different. Right? If you treat it the same, please don't treat it. Like, yeah, don't treat it like radio, don't treat it like programmatic audio. Like you got to treat it different. Like if you just want to get the cheapest out there and get brand recognition and you don't care about attribution, then do it chase low CPMs, get a compelling out and call it a day.</div><div>But if you're going to take podcasting seriously, what Matt said is really great. You come in with a preconceived notion. You're just like this worked in TV, this worked in display. I'm going to combine it, target that same type of thing. In podcasting. If you break your strategies out, deep enough, you can start cutting out shows that don't work there.</div><div>You can see the overlap in demographic or geo or all the, or behavioral, all these different things that can tell you that like, oh, the people in podcasting that respond to this are different than display and video and everything else. And you can change it. You can put more money into the shows that's working.</div><div>You can put a, you can find what's similar about the shows that are working and find new shows that do that you can find targeting across multiple shows that seems to be successful and expand your reach. That's the key thing here, because like Matt was saying, if you just do all the podcasting is exposure, but this big brand, it's just going to show negative lift.</div><div>But if you break out your strategies is going to be a little bit of growth, there's going to be something that just peaks third or even worst case scenario. There's going to be something that is less negative lift than the others, which is still incremental, which is still a positive direction. Like it's</div><div><b>Matt: </b>also</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>my job to say, like,</div><div><b>Matt: </b>if you find this lift result, And the lift results are not that positive.</div><div>And you can't find any positive, then your options are sort of like either go try something completely new. Go spend more money because perhaps that's, the problem is you're just, outspending another channels or maybe podcasting isn't right for your audience. Like you have to say that because that's what these results may be showing you.</div><div>Now, I don't like to turn people away from the podcast industry. I want more and more brands that come into this space because one I'm a believer myself. Like I started listening to podcasting back in this week in tech days, I listened to Leo LaPorte. All the time, listen to Kevin Rose. When he created Diggnation he was one of the first video podcasts, or maybe they call them blogs.</div><div>I don't remember what they called it bloggers back then. Right. I want to see, yeah. I want to see that the success of this industry, but like our job as an attribution providers, just to give you the, like, this is, this is the data. This it is, it is like accurate and this is. We just have to act on what con what came through.</div><div>So like that these are the options that you have to throw out there is perhaps the channels aren't right for you, or you just didn't quite go about it the right way. And like, to go back to this idea of like podcasting is unique and needs to be treated differently. It's so true. I, what I hope doesn't happen is this space goes full programmatic and the ads are being created within the same shop as, as the place where the radio ads are being created or that the creative control is not sort of shared with someone who understands the podcast space, because that that's what.</div><div>From my perspective, those are the types of things that ruined other marketing channels as marketers. We're really good at ruining channels.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I like to describe the scene and up. Where the old man's house is in the center and everything else is bulldoze like advertising is that dude in a suit, like they're not big ad tech isn't in podcasting.</div><div>Like they're not standing on the sidelines out of the goodness of their heart. It's that they can't figure out how to get rid of your house right now. So can</div><div><b>Matt: </b>we talk about QR codes? Like a few, our codes were $150,000 to create a single QR code. People would be thinking really hard about the right way to do that, but because they're free, they're on billboards.</div><div>Yep. Why the shit are you putting a QR code on a billboard, right? It's things like that, that marketers will always</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>ruin. Yep. Yeah. But you know, this is a great place to wrap up because what I want to say here is that mattering LER is probably one of my favorite people in this space. He can go toe to toe with me on all this stuff.</div><div>And I really got to emphasize, as Matt knows when Podsights is the right solution or not. When at podcasts, advert, advertising is the right solution or not for you, he's not going to sell you all day long. So. Well, you enjoy talking to me. If you want to get a different perspective, you're tired of hearing my voice.</div><div>You want to hear it from someone with better hair. Um, then, you know, definitely reach out to Matt and I, and I really want to take this moment to say thank you to the entire Podsights's team, who I pitched the entire idea. It sounds probable to right after James bought into it. And they were my first sponsor and they're a repeat sponsor throughout 2021 and hopefully the future.</div><div>So. You know, pod sets, releases amazing data matter, English spits, great knowledge. We got to get you on Twitter, posting your thoughts and opinions or whatever is useless on there for everybody, all 40 of us that care about it. But, um, Matt, thank you so much. I want to ask you and gonna put you on the spot.</div><div>None of this mainstream crap. What is the podcast that you're listening to the most recent?</div><div><b>Matt: </b>Would it be now the mainstream? I want to hear about nice one</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>for the person who said that. Yeah, but it's a good show. That's great. What else tell people where else?</div><div><b>Matt: </b>Um, I, man, I'm listening to mostly mainstream stuff right now.</div><div>Like I'm listening to a lot of Joe Rogan. I love that Elon Musk interview that he did recently, like three hours of just like ear candy. I can't, I don't know what else to give you. I don't have a Dungeons and dragons podcast that I'm listening to. Right.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Just start one. I think it's, it's, uh, ad tech, uh, like, uh, ad tech and dragons or Dungeons and ad sales.</div><div>Like we're going to make it happen. Ooh.</div><div><b>Matt: </b>I love that idea. Here we go. All right. I'm in that in a 20 sided die, we've got herself a podcast</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>school now. Thanks again for joining me here. And I definitely we'll have you back. All right, man. Sounds good.</div><div>And stick around for some special bonus content. At the end of the episode, I've teamed up with Evo Terra to give you a minute long strategic thought that is guaranteed to shift your perspective on the present and future of podcasting. As we all work. To make podcasting better. Thanks to Matt Dengler for coming on.</div><div>To help us expand on my articles, understanding lift reports, part one and two.

I know that you&apos;re listening to Sounds Profitable because podcast ad tech is important to you, but it&apos;s important to me that you are kept up to date on the latest news from the entire podcast industry to help with that. Here&apos;s what happened last week. No matter when you&apos;re listening from James Cridland at Podnews.
It&apos;s a bit technical, but they&apos;re an intrinsic part of understanding how effective your advertisements are. There&apos;s a bunch of different methodologies for using them and I&apos;ve detailed them at great length. And the two-part article on linking in the description in trying to help explain this as best I could.
I spoke to Matt Drengler from Podsights, a great friend and colleague for too many years about his extensive knowledge in the field of lift reports and attribution. So me and Matt have had a long history together. We were a part of the founding team of barometric that was acquired by Claritas, and it&apos;s still kicking around in the attribution space, big fans of theirs as well.
And Matt helped me a lot with my two part series on understanding lift reports because Lyft reports is an extension of campaign. Attribution are really important right there. The pretty visual at the end of it, that can be used to optimize the campaign or. Honestly for a lot of you out there that hopefully will find value.

Company buy-outs new startups, major shifts in technology and major shifts in procedure can lead to it being a bit arcane to try and grasp the folks at Magellan AI. And I tried to make it a bit more visually understandable with the Podscape. We got together and wrote an article about it, which I've linked in the description.</div><div>Now a few months on our map has already had to evolve. I spoke with Cameron Hendrix and John Goforth about the work we've done and the work that lies ahead to chart these waters better.</div><div>(Shifts to interview, music fades)</div><div>We're going to talk a little bit about the Podscape, which, uh, was released in December. Right? We did it in December of 2020.</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>It feels like ages ago, but yes, December the December 2nd, maybe? Uh,</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>yeah. Yeah, it was very, very early on. And where- we're recording this in January and we're about to actually release, uh, the first update of 2021 right now.</div><div>Yeah.</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>I'm preparing for that end of this week early. Next.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Very cool. Very cool. So, you know, the Podscape for those of you who are just joining us is, uh, our view, the three of us got together and. Kind of tried to show from the advertiser all the way to the listener, what the podcast landscape looks like.</div><div>Cameron and John had an awesome chart that they were keeping internally on their wall at their office. And as they said, they were staring at it to the point where they went cross-eyed they wanted to grab a little bit of additional help. They pulled me in and we collaborated on it. We created a big list.</div><div>We got a bunch of logos. We submitted the first version and I think we doubled the number of companies on there. From the feedback from the first version sounds about, right?</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I feel like we've got maybe a hundred emails between the time that we launch the first and, and, you know, today.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. And I think that that's taught me a very powerful lesson is that there are two ways to get people's attention is to include them and exclude them.</div><div>Um, not intentional, of course, when we did it, because, uh, you know, as you guys said you were getting cross-eyed and then I went across that, looking at it, there's only so many companies that each of us could be responsible for figuring it out. And our goal wasn't to exclude anybody, but it was nice to see that, you know, a lot of people were confident that they should be placed on there and we added them all in.</div><div>Totally. It's</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>like a Cunningham's law that the best way to get the right answer on the internet is to, uh, post the wrong answer. That's</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>that's incredibly accurate.</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>It's exactly what we did the first time around and continue to do</div><div><b>John: </b>it either that we, I mean, this is a very positive thing for the industry, but we're in a very dynamically changing industry.</div><div>This is not an old guard media that has well-established companies. Well-established channels, well established everything. Right. The moment you think you have a grasp on everything that's going on in the podcast world is the moment it changes.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I super agree with that. I think that we have. Not only the acquisitions where we're seeing a lot of companies fold into each other, but you know, funding is constantly happening in the space.</div><div>Um, and there are new partners that are, you know, challenges or active in other channels of advertising or technology that are getting an interest in podcasting. Like I think it's going to be real interesting to see how we represent things like clubhouse or Twitter spaces and their relation to podcasts.</div><div>Yeah. I mean, I think those are, those are two good ones. So why don't we kick off with that? As we're talking about the Podscape and that's such a big thing, right? Audio and other forms that can be recorded as podcasts. Do you think will make space for this?</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>Yeah, I, you know, it's, uh, I think it's a really, for voice in general, I think is one thing that we didn't come into the Podscape initially, like having a great, like are really minds wrapped around, like how, like to think about things like Alexa and you know, other, other ways that people are.</div><div>You know, not just listening to podcasts like you, uh, but also you other like flash briefings and things like that. Right. I think we're at the very early innings of like podcasts in general. Um, I think voice is, you know, even earlier innings, I think there's a world in which we add in folks like clubhouse and Twitter spaces.</div><div>I think that I almost want to. I'm looking at the Podscape right now. I'm just want to make it like a bigger pay. You almost like you're going to make it like a poster, right? This is a fifth right now on an eight and a half by 11 piece of paper. Um, you almost want to have this fit in the scope of a broader, uh, document.</div><div>And so maybe that's what we ended up doing is rolling out something. That's not quite the pod skate, but instead like almost a bigger audio ecosystem document, which, you know, like this doesn't even cover like streaming audio, uh, really like it doesn't, it's not intended to map to streaming audio. I should say.</div><div>You know, we could certainly think about how to make that more effective as well.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah, that could be neat creating like a web, like some sort of tool that would allow people to connect and almost like the whole neighborhood thing that's going on, uh, that we're seeing a lot of with, with the, how to show, like how podcasts are connected.</div><div>Oh, on the content</div><div><b>John: </b>side, like what Steve Pratt was working on. Yeah.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. But if we do that on the company side, right. Like an interactive tool that allowed people to do that. And now the hardest part is, is that this sits in the middle of so many different companies and you guys put time and effort and money into building it out.</div><div>And that's hard. That's hard task. Any company in this space to do. But I, I think you guys know the limitations of it in your looking. To grow it as much as you can. And it's so funny that you mentioned like a bigger size thing. Me and John were joking around with someone on Twitter about how we need to have a beach towel version of it.</div><div>Totally. I think that might have to be some collaborative swag that we do for,</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>I love that. Like that is a that's amazing. I would be like, eh, I have not even thought about printing. That's an anything, but a sheet of paper.</div><div><b>John: </b>I, uh, I said that the black light posters are on the way.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I think, I think a Spencer gifts would be very happy to support us with that model.</div><div><b>John: </b>John, um, uh, spent a lot of money as Spencer gifts on those black light posters, but, uh, you know, Bryan, you bring up a really good point too. I think about, um, When you talk about the intersection of technology and podcasts and what, what defines a podcast, you know, what belongs there and what doesn't belong there from a, from a category perspective, you know, you're, you, you mentioned, I guess what I'd probably call social audio, right?</div><div>With, um, with clubhouse in Twitter spaces, you know, the, the same, the same is that, uh, another question around that might be the, um, the, uh, recent endeavor I'm forgetting who did with Alec Baldwin, the audio book. That they did around the election or around the inauguration. There was, there was an audio book that there, oh, it was, um, uh, Malcolm Gladwell's company, uh, pushing, uh, and, uh, they released, they released an audio book via RSS they had to pay for.</div><div>And so it's, there's a lot of interesting questions coming up about, you know, what is a podcast what's so what, what categories do these things belong in? You know, there's certainly you, you, you can see the arguments on Twitter. There's the folks that believe that, you know, a podcast is very well-defined as a.</div><div>You know, open RSS feed audio with audio and closed, and then, you know, there's other folks that say, well, no, I mean, can we get a little looser about this definition? And it's certainly a fun debate, but, uh, nonetheless, I'm just glad that there is more and more and more to choose from more opportunity, more.</div><div>Uh, I love the expansion of the industry.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. I think one of the things that you just hit on there is like all these other mindsets that are not necessarily ad focused or don't have to be by default. Right? The pet scan shows the advertising landscape from advertiser to listener and like on the, on the industry side, right.</div><div>We're trying to show all these people that are working that are not on the mic that are not on the mixing board. That are growing these podcasts and supporting it. And we even list on there, like the, the membership-based things like Patrion, super cast member full, and, and those are really neat. I think what people forget is that when you think about it, like other media types, like.</div><div>You know, when a movie comes out, there's product placement in it, there's still advertisement. Like, just because you're paying for that content. And nobody is like interrupting it with an ad. Doesn't mean there isn't advertising. So a lot of these people view advertising as such a negative thing, and they're, they're all excited to figure it out.</div><div>All these other sources for revenue, for podcasters, which I think the three of us all agree, like we want. People that get paid because we want more people in the space so that we can build cool technology that helps more people. Absolutely. But it's shortsighted to assume that Pushkin is going to sell like audio books through RSS feeds and not one time go.</div><div>And this audio book is brought to you by state farm. Right. That's it that one time right now that's an advertisement spot. That's a high tier one that might cost more than some of the other CPM based stuff, because it's exclusive because it's part of a paid thing. So you have such an engaged audience.</div><div>So I don't know, overall, I think, I think the space is so neat and the technology is so neat and I think it's very cool that we're in a position where, where people are working with us collaboratively. To build out this view of it. And we we've admitted that it's, US-based, I've heard some chatter that people are working to do like an Australia based version of the pots scape.</div><div>Has anybody reached out to you guys about that? No. I mean,</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>we've heard some, a few, a few companies have reached out like asking to be put on the Podscape and I think we've tried to, you know, add really anyone in the space like match cast, for example, I believe it Asia-based. Yeah. Yeah. It is really a challenge.</div><div>Cause you start getting into like, well, a lot of these like hosting platforms are, uh, You know, international as well. Right? So they have clients in both the us and every other market out there because it really offered operating like a software business on the internet. Right. So by nature, to some extent it's global, but there are certainly, you know, companies in, um, each individual market that are unique to those markets and really focused on those markets.</div><div>So, uh, I, I certainly think, I think, and that's. Good again. It all goes back to like, why we put this out in the first place is like to start a conversation about what the market is, what the shape of it is and how it flows. And, and, uh, it's certainly not meant to, there will be, there will be no time. I, I, that I anticipate this will be the final end all version of a, of a pod podcast market map.</div><div>Um, you know, whether that's US-based or global.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. W I, I truly believe that's true. I believe that's true because. Uh, like that will only happen when we close the doors on podcasting, where we look at it as history, because it's done, right. Like I'm excited with how much movement there is here and you're right.</div><div>I mean, anybody who reaches out, we add them to it. I am excited to see the acquisition aspect and being able to take that trail there and the overall growth. And you, you hit on a cool thing. This is a conversation in public, and I think this space, the podcasting space. Is unique because it is a community.</div><div>Like everybody hates those tropes that people are invested in podcasting, but a lot of the technology that people are building here, if you went and applied it to another digital channel first, you could probably be more successful. You could have less headache, less work in some situations, more revenue and higher margin in these established areas.</div><div>But everybody's in podcasting because they like something about it. So every time an open conversation happens in the space. More people come to the table, more people collaborate on these things. It's, it's hard because there's still only a billion dollars in ad revenue. And so people are like fighting each other for it.</div><div>But, um, I'm really excited for a world where all of these partners come together, understand their value prop may get publicly available. Talk about it in a communal space and know that like, If everybody positions themselves fairly and we stop with the, the number one, the first, the only, the premiere, whatever keyword that your marketing person has, we're going to find people buying and using products that specialize right.</div><div>And specifically what you want instead of buying into one thing. And then just wishing you knew more about what the other competitors had</div><div><b>John: </b>and to your point. This industry is growing, uh, maybe not at the clip that we'd all like, but it's growing at a, at a nice clip and. The the way it's going to mature even further is more monetization.</div><div>I don't mean more ads in a single podcast or anything like that. I'm not, not, not sales guy. You got to do the sound on opinion one. Yeah, no, there's nothing to do with that, but I do know that companies have to make more money in order for them to continue to invest in this channel versus another channel.</div><div>And I think that was, that was one of the original reasons. Reasons that Cameron and I started talking about doing a version of the Podscape was there's always been a lot of chatter about content, how to make better content there's constant debates and have been, since I've been in the industry for over like over five years now about, you know, what's the optimal length, what's the optimal data release.</div><div>How, how, what, what, uh, what's the frequency in which you should release? I go all of these basic fundamental foundational questions around content. But those questions haven't been asked nearly as much in the monetization side of the world. And, and, you know, obviously the Podscape is, is meant to be a reflection of the podcast advertising industry and all of the different tentacles that spawn out of that, or that feed into that.</div><div>But I'm glad to be, as you said, Bryan, haven't been having a public conversation about the, uh, about these companies and how they all fit together categorized.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. And you know, I want to, I want to give you guys credit for, you know, not only. Initiating the Podscape and really leading it forward, but also kind of stepping up as Magellan as well for, um, opening up these public conversations, sharing this information.</div><div>I want to highlight your, your new website, really good podcast ads, because you guys go through a lot of effort to make sure that you are accurately finding all of the podcasts ads out there. Through transcription and you know, it's not trivial to identify when, and it's an ad to, you know, hit a podcast multiple times to find dynamic ad insertion and, and really dig all that stuff out.</div><div>And so for you guys to put the effort into building a, a free to use tool for people to learn about some of the best performing ads out there, That's amazing. I mean, it blows my mind that we're not seeing these companies that are building these ads, whether they're publishers or agencies or whatnot, putting them on their website.</div><div>Like if I, when I go and look at a podcast network, if I is so many of them, I can't even hit play to listen to a podcast immediately. So when, you know, there's a major podcast agency and I go to their website and I can't listen to one of the ads that they're responsible for and go, oh, you're so big that I know that ad, like it blows my mind.</div><div>So you guys putting it in one place helps them grow or like helps everybody grow because there's creativity to be found in advertising. That we haven't touched on. We are so focused on how do we commoditize it? How do we get it into trade desks or someone who doesn't want to be here can throw money at it and contribute to the growth.</div><div>But the success of podcasting really is coming from the people who are like, okay, I'm here. I want to learn it. And that what a, what a killer resource, what a, what a great way to, you know, uh, put your money where your mouth is and, you know, congratulations to you guys on that. Thank you. I</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>think one of the things that, you know, going back to like 2017, when we first started tracking, you know, start ads in podcast space, like one of the things that made it so pleasant to be in this business is that like listening to the ads was fun.</div><div>Like, I didn't actually. Like hate my job. Um, as a, you know, cause you know, and of course as like the founder I was doing, you know, everything from, you know, sending emails, cold emails to actually like making sure the ship, you know, uh, sailed on time. Um, and that involved listening to a lot of ads. So. But yeah, the, the really good podcast ads, you know, was just, I think that an evolution of that and us continuing to like stand on the shoulders of like the really fantastic podcast hosts and really fantastic advertisers out there that are like pushing the envelope with very cool content, you know, ad creative is a challenge, you know, it's like having, having, we've just started trying to really like.</div><div>Put ourselves out there. And, and that's part of what you see with these projects, like Podscape and really good podcast ads, but it's a challenge to figure out how you like carve out your voice and, and seeing how other companies who've done. It is really, uh, educational.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah. I think there's so much room for people to try things right now.</div><div>Like I think that. We're not at a point where a misstep by a company exploring something means that you just lost out on a budget, right? Like there was a major automotive insurance company, or I guess they're a more than just automotive that I worked with when I first got into this space and podcasting.</div><div>And it was just so funny that people would be like, Is our campaign performing well, I don't think the lift percentages is good enough. And I was like, Hey guys, here's the secret. It doesn't really matter what the campaign does at the end of it. If you can tell them how you can do better next time and show why you're unique, that's what they want to hear.</div><div>And I think a lot of that's still true. I mean, I think the people who are in podcasting or either trying to chase Facebook, direct response and good luck, I don't think it translates as well. Um, or, or want to be here because they want to see what can be done and what's unique about it and what sticks.</div><div>So I think that you can't phone it in, but. I think creative bravery is how Pacific content put it. I think that's going to be very well rewarded this year. Well, and I also</div><div><b>John: </b>think that that sometimes people try to have a binary conversation either. We're moving this as, as an industry, we're moving towards the more digital space where everything operates a certain way.</div><div>It's all, uh, you know, here are the ad specs and just go to town and, and it becomes very commoditized. Um, or you're, uh, you're on the, the other side of the coin where, uh, it is, it is all pure. Everything needs to be baked in. They need to be five minute long ads and they're very creative. And I think to say it has to be one or the other is like kind of a failure of imagination.</div><div>Like there are, there are dif they make different types of cars for different people because different people have different needs. And I think the same is true of advertisers in the podcast space. They have different needs. They have, they have multichannel, um, approaches to their marketing in general podcasts.</div><div>Aren't the only thing they do. And what, what fits for company a might not fit for company B and that's. Okay. And, and, and the more diversity of, of opportunity and offering that the industry can, uh, can put out there just means more folks jumped into the pool and please come on in the water's warm.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Completely agree. It, you know, you hit on something that, that made me think about an experience I had recently. Uh, so I was losing my mind that the second season a Mandalorian had various episode flanks, right? Like first one was like 45 minutes and then it kept getting lower and lower. And there was one at like the 30 something or 27.</div><div>It must've been thirties on the minutes, but I was just like, come on, you can't make it any shorter. And what I've realized is that these creative shops have finally got the freedom they're detached from fitting into a half an hour or an hour long slot on cable, where there's X amount of ads that have to go in there.</div><div>So the show has to be a certain amount of time and it means there's less filler. Like, could you imagine what lost would have been like if they didn't have to adhere to a cable broadcast? Um, but what's so funny is that the people that build content often are the first people that yell how much they hate ads.</div><div>Well, I would kill for some of those people to come create better ads. Like I don't think anybody really hates advertising because most people want to be sold something as the truth. If you can put the right product in front of me, if you can attract me the right way with it, where we're all consumers, um, people hate bad ads.</div><div>Uh, and I hope, I hope we start to see these genius creative people look at advertisement as short form content. With a specific goal and really give us something new to chew on, you know?</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>Yeah. And we've seen a, I feel like I have a conversation with a publisher every other week or more frequently than that in some cases about how to make, what, what, know what other people are doing in the market.</div><div>Like, what's exciting about what people are bringing to market. Uh, and you know, it's definitely, there's plenty of room to run, like in terms of like, uh, imagination around, um, what ads like ads could look like in 20, 21 and beyond.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah, I would kill for you guys to do a podcast, a weekly podcast where you grab the top five or 10 ads that are coming through message over to the people who create it and just get them to take like one or two minutes explaining what went through their creative process with it.</div><div>And you guys kind of curating that all together. I love it.</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>The, uh, the, you know, I think with any, any person who works in tech probably has this like problem, but I have a problem with buying domains. Um, whenever I have like an idea for two seconds and I feel like. Three years ago, I've been paying for this domain, like podcast ads, podcast.com or something.</div><div>Uh, and, uh, it's just, uh, it's been sitting there unused, but maybe there's an opportunity.</div><div><b>John: </b>Maybe there's a podcast in there.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I love it. Well, I like to end every episode with, uh, putting everybody on the spot and asking for a podcast that's not super mainstream that you guys listened to. Uh, so, you know, Cameron, let me, let me know what you, what you're listening to nowadays.</div><div>Let's see, I'm</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>going to pull up my, uh, my overcast here. Um, and I'm going to filter for not too mainstream. Okay. I will give you one, um, which is, uh, a lab. Um, all lawyers are bad, uh, a lab series. Um, it's, it's actually, it's ByLawyers um, this is not controversial. Uh, they, it is a very good podcast, like kind of getting into some, like, really fun, like legal takes on different situations that have happened.</div><div>Uh, like there was a. Like I think some, yeah, they just, they have like a, it looks like about 20 episodes. Um, but it's like a really fun kind of sharp, uh, podcast or the three or four hosts who you get on and talk about like weird, uh,</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>uh, law issues. That's pretty cool. And John. Uh,</div><div><b>John: </b>so I, I recently started bingeing a, um, uh, I'm not going to say, I mean, it's, it's more mainstream than some, but a head gum show called the dead eyes.</div><div>I wasn't too familiar with it, but this a comedian Connor Ratliff, um, long story short, he got a part in the, the. HBO TV series, band of brothers. He was cast for it. And at the very last minute he got a call that he needed to come audition again, even though he had already been casting audition for Tom Hanks, because Tom Hanks was, was hosting that, uh, or not host AMSTAR directing that, that particular episode.</div><div>And, uh, he got a call after he did the audition saying, uh, I'm sorry, but, uh, we're, we're going in another direction, Tom Hanks thought you had dead eyes and he's now in season two of exploring. What exactly that meant. Is that the way the story went down? Um, it's kind of like, uh, it's like if cereal was about the most mundane and unimportant topic out there, you know, nobody got murdered or he just wants to figure it out, figure out why he got fired from a TV show 20 years ago.</div><div>Um, it's, it's actually, it's really, it's, it's funny. It's heartwarming. It's uh, it's well done.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Awesome. Yeah. I only pushed the mainstream because I don't want to hear about how great nice white parents is, uh, for the 10th time. Uh, not that I really enjoyed it, but. That's why I push on that end, but guys, it was so great having you on here.</div><div>I'm positive. I'll have you back again. Um, you're doing some really great things and, and you're, you're practicing one of my favorite things, which is pitching in public, right? Your content, everything that you guys are doing, all that we can know about Magellan is available pretty accessibly in different ways.</div><div>So. Thank you so much for everything you do. And, uh, thank you for helping with the podcast being a big part of bringing that to this committee.</div><div><b>Cameron: </b>Yeah. Thank you. It's been a pleasure working together on the Podscape and I'm looking forward to continuing to, uh, this year and beyond.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>Yeah.</div><div><b>John: </b>Yeah. And thanks for what you, uh, thanks for your writing.</div><div>Uh, w it's it's nice to have a, a newsletter out there covering the ad tech space. We, we, we certainly appreciate it and read it every week. And, uh, uh, I, I, being that I am on the sales side, I do have to say if you'd like to learn more, go to</div><div>magellan.ai.</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>I'll leave that one in you guys get that one. (jokingly)</div><div><b>John: </b>All right. (excited)</div><div><b>Bryan: </b>All right. Thanks guys. Thanks.</div><div>(music rises, interview ends)</div><div>And stick around for some special bonus content. At the end of the episode, I've teamed up with Evo Terra to give you a minute long strategic thought that is guaranteed to shift your perspective on the present and future of podcasting. As we all work.

      <itunes:summary>The podcasting advertising landscape is ever changing. Even the most recent map that I helped work on with the help of Magellan AI is already in need of updates.

Bryan: Madness post-its and the Podscape. That&apos;s what we&apos;re talking about today on sound&apos;s profitable with me, Bryan Barletta.
This episode is sponsored by Claritas. Check out their recent, the marketing insider podcast, and learn how to use current trends, such as industry specific, lift success and CPM comparisons in podcasting to increase advertiser adoption. You can find out more at Claritas dot com.
I know that you&apos;re listening to Sounds Profitable because podcast ad tech is important to you, but it&apos;s important to me that you are kept up to date on the latest news from the entire podcast industry. To help with that. Here&apos;s what happened last week. No matter when you&apos;re listening from James Cridland at Podnews.
The podcast advertising ecosystem is ever changing. Company buy-outs new startups, major shifts in technology and major shifts in procedure can lead to it being a bit arcane to try and grasp the folks at Magellan AI. And I tried to make it a bit more visually understandable with the Podscape. We got together and wrote an article about it, which I&apos;ve linked in the description.
Now a few months on our map has already had to evolve. I spoke with Cameron Hendrix and John Goforth about the work we&apos;ve done and the work that lies ahead to chart these waters better.
(Shifts to interview, music fades)
We&apos;re going to talk a little bit about the Podscape, which, uh, was released in December. Right? We did it in December of 2020.
Cameron: It feels like ages ago, but yes, December the December 2nd, maybe? Uh,
Bryan: yeah. Yeah, it was very, very early on. And where- we&apos;...</itunes:summary>
